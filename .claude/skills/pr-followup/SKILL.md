  Handle post-PR-creation follow-ups: fix CI failures, address review comments,
  reply to reviewers, and resolve conversations. Use when the user says
  "CIが落ちている", "reviewコメントに対応して", "PRのコメントを確認して",
  "PR #NNN を直して", or asks to fix a failing PR. Reads CI logs and review
  comments, makes targeted fixes, pushes, and replies. If a review comment
  requires a fundamental design change, escalate to the user instead of
  attempting it.

# PR follow-up

Fix CI failures and address review comments on an existing PR.
This is a **focused fix-and-reply** skill — scoped to the PR's branch.

Invoked directly, or as one iteration of an automated tail: after
[`implement-be`](../implement-be/SKILL.md) opens the Draft PR and compacts, it runs
`/loop /pr-followup #NNN` to drive this skill on a paced schedule until the PR is quiet and green.
The conflict check, the `CHANGES_REQUESTED` stop condition, and the iteration backstops all live in
that loop layer — this skill itself is unchanged and behaves identically whether looped or called
by hand.

## Inputs

The user provides one of:
- A PR number (`#NNN`)
- A branch name
- "the current PR" (use the current branch's PR)

## Steps

### 1. Assess the PR state

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --json number,title,headRefName,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision
gh pr checks <PR>
```

### 2. Fix CI failures (if any)

- Read the failing check's log:
  ```bash
  gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
  ```
- Identify the root cause from the log output.
- Make the targeted fix on the PR's branch.
- Run `make check` locally to verify.
- Push the fix.

### 3. Address review comments

- List unresolved review comments:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments --jq '.[] | select(.position != null) | {id, path, line: .original_line, body}'
  ```
- For each comment:
  1. Read the comment and understand the request.
  2. Make the code change if it's a targeted fix.
  3. Run `make check` to verify.
  4. Reply to the comment explaining what was changed.
  5. Resolve the conversation if the fix addresses it.

### 4. Push and report

- Push all fixes in one commit (or logical commits if changes are independent).
- Report what was fixed and what remains.

## Escalation

If a review comment asks for a **fundamental design change** (new approach,
architectural rethink, or trade-off the user should weigh), do NOT attempt the
fix. Instead:
- Summarize the request
- Explain why it needs the user's judgment
- Suggest starting an Opus session for the redesign

## What this skill does NOT do

- Rewrite large sections of code
- Make design decisions on behalf of the user
- Force-push or rebase (push incremental fix commits)
- Create new PRs
