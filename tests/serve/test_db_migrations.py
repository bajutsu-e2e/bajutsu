"""The initial Alembic migration must build the same schema as the ORM metadata (BE-0015 7a-2) —
a guard against the migration drifting from models.py. It compares a per-table schema signature
(columns + types + nullability, foreign keys, unique constraints), not just the set of table names,
so a column or constraint that drifts is caught too.

The upgrade/downgrade tests are parametrized over both dialects (BE-0309): the fast gate runs them
against a throwaway SQLite file, and the serve-db.yml lane reruns the same assertions against a real
Postgres service — the only place the dialect-specific migration code (0010's `postgresql` FK branch
and the JSONB column variants) actually executes. Running against Postgres requires both
`BAJUTSU_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` and `BAJUTSU_REQUIRE_POSTGRES` to be set (the URL alone skips, so a
developer who accidentally exports the URL against a non-throwaway database can't silently destroy
data via the `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` reset)."""
