"""Tests for the OIDC exchange endpoint and the machine session it mints (BE-0414 unit 1).

The third caller shape, end to end: a CI job presents its OIDC token once, `serve` verifies it and
mints a short-lived machine session, and every later call in the pipeline is an ordinary session
request. Offline throughout — the issuer's keys are generated in-process and injected through
`JwksCache`'s `fetch` seam, so no test reaches the network.

What a machine session may *do* is BE-0414 unit 3's endpoint allowlist. Until it lands a machine
principal is refused everywhere, which these tests lock in both backends: the exchange is testable
on its own, and nothing it mints can reach an endpoint the allowlist has not yet opened.
