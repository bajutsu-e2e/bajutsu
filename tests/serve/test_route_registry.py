"""The declarative serve route registry and its path matcher (BE-0253 Part 1).

These lock the registry's shape and the matcher's precedence so the stdlib handler's
registry-driven dispatch (Part 2) — and, later, the FastAPI generator (Part 3) — stay in
lockstep with the hand-enumerated route table below. The parity set is the guard that the
Part 2 refactor drops or adds nothing.
