"""Database-backed org lifecycle and membership for serve (BE-0375).

What these lock: the database, not the `orgs:` block, decides who signs in as which org once one is
wired; a configuration that fails to load no longer denies anyone there, while a database that
cannot be read says so with a 5xx instead of blaming a user's GitHub membership; a target's identity
is `(org, target)`, so two orgs may each claim one name; the four admin `/api/orgs…` endpoints
create, re-member, and retire a tenant, each audited; the backfill seeds each org row exactly once
and a later configuration edit cannot overwrite it; and the admin-Team bypass still admits a sign-in
against an empty table so the first org can be created at all.
