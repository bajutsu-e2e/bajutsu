"""The `handleSystemAlert` step's wait, moved out of the XCUITest driver (BE-0406 Unit 1).

The driver now queries SpringBoard once and taps; the waiting is a condition wait the orchestrator
owns, so the reactive guard can clear a declared interruption *while* the step waits instead of only
after it has already spent its timeout. Exercised against `FakeDriver`, which advertises
`HANDLE_SYSTEM_ALERT` and can be seeded with alert buttons, so nothing here needs a Simulator.
