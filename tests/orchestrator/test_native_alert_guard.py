"""Tests for the reactive native system-alert guard path (BE-0315).

The reactive guard clears SpringBoard prompts automatically, preferring a deterministic native path
built on BE-0316's primitives — `system_alert_labels()` (a read of BE-0316's `/systemAlert/query`)
to see the alert's buttons, then `handle_system_alert()` to tap a policy-named one — over the vision
fallback. Exercised against `FakeDriver`, which advertises `HANDLE_SYSTEM_ALERT` and can be seeded
with alert buttons, so nothing here needs a Simulator; the on-device confirmation is a separate lane.
