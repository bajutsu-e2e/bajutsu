"""Tests for the XCUITest environment's target selection (BE-0238 Unit 1).

BE-0019 drove only the Simulator; BE-0238 generalises the same `xcodebuild test-without-building`
driving layer to a real iOS device, where the only difference is the `-destination` platform and
that the simctl device-prep (erase / boot / install / permissions) does not apply. The Simulator's
own boot path still needs Xcode, so it stays off the gate; here the target-selection logic and the
loud refusal of simctl-only operations against a real device are exercised without one — the
`xcodebuild`/toolchain boundary is the sanctioned fake point (the same one BE-0019 fakes).
