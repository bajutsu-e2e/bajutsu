## Introduction

Ship a **slim, containerized Linux worker for the web (Playwright) backend**, so the hosted topology
can run `bajutsu worker` as a small OCI image rather than a hand-provisioned machine. The image
carries only the worker's true runtime closure — the base package, the `web` backend, and the
assertion extras a run actually reaches (`visual`, `schema`) — and deliberately omits the control
plane's dependencies (`server`, `db`, `oauth`, `cloud`) and the AI SDK (`ai`). This is now possible
because [BE-0160](../BE-0160-worker-credential-free-uploads/BE-0160-worker-credential-free-uploads.md)
made the worker **credential- and cloud-SDK-free**: it talks to the control plane and object storage
over plain HTTP, so a worker image needs no `boto3`/GCS SDK and no cloud secrets baked in.

## Motivation

The self-hosted deploy bundle ([BE-0016](../BE-0016-web-ui-self-hosting/BE-0016-web-ui-self-hosting.md),
`deploy/self-host/`) today runs the Linux control plane in a container and the **Mac workers on bare
metal** — the Mac worker is not containerized because it needs the Aqua GUI session for the iOS
Simulator (idb backend). The web (Playwright) backend runs **headless on Linux**, so a web worker
carries no such constraint and can be a container. When we host on the web, a **Linux web-worker in
the fleet is a target topology** — so the web worker wants a first-class, reproducible image, not an
ad-hoc `uv sync` on a VM.

Two things make a *slim* image worth designing deliberately rather than installing the whole package:

- **Deploy weight.** A naive image that installs the full dependency set pulls the control plane's
  stack (`fastapi`/`uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`/`alembic`/`psycopg`), the cloud SDKs (`boto3`, GCS), and
  the AI SDK (`anthropic`) — on the order of a few hundred MB of wheels the worker never imports.
  BE-0160 is precisely what lets us drop them: the worker's network dependency is an HTTP client, not
  a cloud SDK. The remaining weight is dominated by the Chromium binary Playwright needs, which is
  irreducible for a browser-driving worker — but everything above it is avoidable, and a smaller image
  pulls and cold-starts faster across a scaling fleet.
- **A named runtime closure.** Today the docs install the worker as `bajutsu[idb]`, but a run also
  reaches `pillow` (visual assertions) and `jsonschema` (`responseSchema` assertions) — so
  `bajutsu[idb]` alone *under-installs*, and such a run fails lazily at assertion time. There is no
  single name for "what a worker must install", for either backend. Defining that closure fixes the
  gap for the Mac worker too, and is the exact input the container build consumes.

The web worker is also a **new capability axis** for the pool. [BE-0166](../BE-0166-capability-routed-queues/BE-0166-capability-routed-queues.md)
routes jobs to workers by capability, but frames the heterogeneous pool as Mac workers differing in
iOS runtime / device class — it does not yet treat **backend (idb vs web)** as a routing dimension.
A Linux web worker introduces `backend=web` as a capability; the slim image is the vehicle that
delivers that capability, and BE-0166 is the routing that sends web jobs to it. This item adds the
image and the runtime closure; extending BE-0166 with the backend dimension is tracked there (see
*Detailed design* §5).

## Detailed design

The work is the deploy artifact plus the packaging and guardrail that make it correct and keep it
slim. Nothing here touches the deterministic `run`/CI gate or puts an LLM on the verdict path — it is
packaging, a Dockerfile, and docs.

### 1. Define the worker runtime-closure extras

Add composite extras in `pyproject.toml` that name exactly what a worker must install per backend,
composed from the existing single-purpose extras (no version duplication):

- `worker-web = ["bajutsu[web,visual,schema]"]`
- `worker-idb = ["bajutsu[idb,visual,schema]"]`

The `ai` extra stays **opt-in** and out of the closure — a worker only needs it when scenarios use
the AI authoring/investigation paths (`record`, `run --dismiss-alerts`), consistent with the
base-AI-free guarantee. The container build (§2) and the Mac worker install docs both consume
`worker-web` / `worker-idb`, so "what a worker installs" lives in one place.

### 2. Multi-stage Dockerfile for the web worker

Add `deploy/self-host/worker-web.Dockerfile` (name TBD) as a multi-stage build:

- **Build stage**: install `bajutsu[worker-web]` into a virtual environment with `uv` (from the
  built wheel, not an editable checkout).
- **Final stage**: a slim Python base + the venv + the Chromium browser Playwright needs, and nothing
  from `server`/`db`/`oauth`/`cloud`/`ai`. The Chromium binary is installed with `playwright install
  --with-deps chromium`; alternatively the final stage builds on the upstream Playwright Python image
  (browsers + OS libraries preinstalled) — the Alternatives section weighs the two.
- Entrypoint runs `bajutsu worker`, configured by environment (`BAJUTSU_SERVER_URL`, `BAJUTSU_TOKEN`)
  exactly as the bare-metal worker is, and — per BE-0160 — with **no** object-store credentials.

### 3. Compose service + self-hosting docs

Add an **optional** `worker-web` service to `deploy/self-host/docker-compose.yml` (off by default, so
an idb-only single-tenant deploy is unchanged), and document the **heterogeneous fleet** in
`docs/self-hosting.md` and its Japanese mirror: Mac idb workers on bare metal (Aqua GUI) + Linux web
workers as containers, both leasing from the same control plane over HTTP. State plainly that the web
worker image needs no cloud SDK or secrets (BE-0160), and which extras back it (§1).

### 4. Cold-start / closure guard test

Add a test that asserts the worker's import closure stays lean — importing the `worker` command path
must **not** import `fastapi`/`uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `boto3`/GCS, or `anthropic` — so a stray
top-level import can never silently re-inflate the image or slow worker cold-start. This extends the
existing import-guard approach (`tests/serve/test_import_guard.py`) to the worker entry, and runs in
the standard gate (no Simulator, Linux-friendly).

### 5. BE-0166: backend as a capability axis (cross-item)

Record `backend` (idb vs web) as a routing dimension so a `web` job is only leased by a web worker and
an `idb` job only by a Mac worker. This is a small addition to
[BE-0166](../BE-0166-capability-routed-queues/BE-0166-capability-routed-queues.md)'s design, not new
code here; this item and BE-0166 cross-reference each other. (Until BE-0166 lands, a homogeneous
web-only or idb-only pool is unaffected — this matters only once the pool mixes backends.)

## Alternatives considered

### A. Install the full package in the worker image

Build the image from `bajutsu[web]` plus whatever else, or the whole dependency set. Simpler to write,
but pulls the control plane / cloud / AI stacks the worker never imports — the avoidable weight this
item removes. BE-0160 is what makes dropping them safe, so not doing so wastes that win.

### B. Build on the upstream Playwright Python image vs. `playwright install` ourselves

Basing the final stage on `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python` ships browsers and OS libraries
preinstalled and version-matched, at the cost of a larger, less-controlled base and an external base
dependency. Installing Chromium ourselves onto a slim Python base keeps the base minimal and fully
ours, at the cost of maintaining the `--with-deps` system-library step. The image should pick one and
document why; this proposal leans toward the self-installed slim base for control, pending a size
comparison.

### C. Containerize the Mac (idb) worker too

Out of scope and not feasible: the idb backend needs the Aqua GUI session and the iOS Simulator, which
a Linux container cannot provide. The Mac worker stays bare metal; §1's `worker-idb` extra still
improves its bare-metal install. The container story is web-only by nature.

### D. Split the worker into a separate distribution (`bajutsu-worker` wheel)

Publish a second package holding only the worker/run/backend code. This would shave the *source* of
`serve`/`mcp`/`ai` modules, but that is pure Python of negligible size — the real weight is in
dependencies, which the extras (§1) already gate. Splitting the distribution cuts against the
"one package = one deterministic core" shape and adds release-process overhead for a marginal size
win, so it is not adopted.
