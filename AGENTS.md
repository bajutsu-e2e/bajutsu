# AGENTS.md

This repository's agent instructions live in **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** — the single
source of truth for both Claude Code and any other AI coding agent (Codex, Cursor, etc.).

Please read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) before starting. In short:

- **Verify with `make check`** (ruff + mypy + pytest) before calling a change done and before
  pushing. It mirrors CI exactly.
- **AI never judges a `run`.** Pass/fail is deterministic, from machine assertions only — never
  add an LLM call to the run/CI gate.
- **Work in parallel safely:** one topic per `claude/<topic>` branch, keep changes small, never
  push red (the pre-push hook enforces the gate), rebase on `origin/main` before pushing.
  Full guide: [`docs/ai-development.md`](docs/ai-development.md).
