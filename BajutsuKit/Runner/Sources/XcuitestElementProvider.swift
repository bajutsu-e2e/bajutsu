/// BE-0105 makes the query cheap: instead of materializing an `XCUIElement` per node and reading
/// each attribute over its own XCUITest round-trip (elements × attributes ≈ 600 trips for one
/// screen), `queryElements()` takes **one** `app.snapshot()` and reads every attribute from that
/// tree. The trade-off is that snapshot nodes are values, not tappable elements, so each element's
/// backing records its identity and root-relative position path. `tap` / `gesture` re-derive the
/// live `XCUIElement` from that position path — one cheap resolution — and fall back to a narrow
/// identity query only when the path no longer resolves, which also reaches system-owned sheets
/// whose snapshot hierarchy cannot be replayed through live direct-child queries.
/// Backs a SpringBoard alert button by its ordinal within `springboard.alerts.buttons` (BE-0316).
