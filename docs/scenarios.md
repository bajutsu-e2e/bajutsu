# Scenario specification (authoring reference)

A [scenario](glossary.md#scenario-authoring) is Bajutsu's **only persisted artifact**: plain YAML, version-controlled in git and reviewable in a PR. `record` (AI) writes it the first time; humans own and edit it afterward. `run` executes this structure without AI.

Implementation: `bajutsu/scenario/` (pydantic models under `models/`, `extra="forbid"` rejects unknown keys).

The **normative grammar** — every production, type, default, and validation rule — is in [dsl-grammar](dsl-grammar.md). This page is the authoring guide: how to write a scenario, by example.

## File shape

One file = **a list of scenarios**, or a `{ description, scenarios }` mapping when you want a
file-level description. `load_scenarios()` accepts either form; a top level that is neither is
rejected.

```yaml
- name: ...        # scenario 1
  steps: [...]
- name: ...        # scenario 2
  steps: [...]
```

With a file-level description (and an optional per-scenario `description`):

```yaml
description: What this file covers.
scenarios:
  - name: ...
    description: What this scenario checks.
    steps: [...]
```

Both the file description and each scenario's `description` appear in `report.html` (the
summary header and each scenario card) and in the `bajutsu serve` UI.

### Schema version

The mapping form may carry a top-level `schema` integer marking the scenario schema version. A file
that omits it is treated as version 1, so every existing scenario is valid unchanged:

```yaml
schema: 1
scenarios:
  - name: ...
    steps: [...]
```

When a scenario declares a `schema` newer than the running `bajutsu` understands, the load fails
with a clear upgrade-path message instead of an opaque "unknown field" error — the case that arises
once a scenario tree is read across versions (for example, a config sourced from a pinned Git ref).
The current version is `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `bajutsu/scenario/models/scenario.py`. Bump it only for a
load-breaking change — removing a required field's meaning, or a change an older `bajutsu` would
misinterpret rather than merely reject; a purely additive optional field needs no bump.

## Top-level structure (`Scenario`)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | str | required | Scenario name (used for the report / JUnit testcase / codegen method name) |
| `description` | str | none | Optional human description; shown on the scenario's report card and in the serve UI |
| `from` | str | none | **Provenance** — the natural-language goal `record` authored this scenario from ([provenance](#from-provenance)). Authoring metadata only; `run` ignores it |
| `tags` | list[str] | `[]` | Selection labels; the CLI `--tag` / `--exclude` flags pick which scenarios run ([reuse, data, and tags](#reuse-data-and-tags)) |
| `data` / `dataFile` | list / str | none | Data-driven rows — inline `data`, or `dataFile` (a CSV path). Expands into one run per row, substituting `${row.col}`. Mutually exclusive ([reuse, data, and tags](#reuse-data-and-tags)) |
| `preconditions` | object | `{}` | Per-test environment setup (below) |
| `before` | list | `[]` | Setup steps run as their **own phase** ahead of `steps`; a failure there aborts the scenario ([below](#before--after-setup-and-teardown-phases)) |
| `steps` | list | required | The ordered actions (below) |
| `expect` | list | `[]` | Final assertions after all steps pass ([selectors](selectors.md#assertion-evaluation)) |
| `after` | list | `[]` | Teardown rules — each `{ on: always \| success \| error, steps }`, run once the verdict exists, on every path out of `steps` ([below](#before--after-setup-and-teardown-phases)) |
| `capturePolicy` | list | `[]` | Repeatedly-firing evidence rules ([evidence](evidence.md#a-capturepolicy-rule-based)) |
| `network` | object | none | `{ filter: { domains: [...] } }` — `filter.domains` scopes which observed requests are interleaved into the report's Steps timeline (by URL host; a parent domain matches subdomains). Unset shows all; the Network tab always lists them all ([reporting](reporting.md#reporthtml)) |
| `mocks` | list | `[]` | Deterministic network stubs — a matching outgoing request gets a canned response instead of hitting the network ([network mocks](#network-mocks-deterministic-stubs)) |
| `redact` | object | none | Masking applied before evidence is written ([evidence](evidence.md#masking-redact)) |
| `systemAlertHandling` | bool / object | none (on) | The reactive **alert guard** — clears OS prompts the iOS backend cannot see, natively on XCUITest (no model, reusing BE-0316) with vision as the fallback. On by default; `false` disables it, `{ instruction: ["Allow"] }` keeps it on but taps a named button, `{ pollInterval: 2 }` retunes the native poll cadence. CLI `--system-alert-handling`/`--no-system-alert-handling` overrides ([below](#systemalerthandling-the-system-alert-guard)) |
| `iosTipKitHandling` | bool | none (off) | Dismiss a blocking Apple **TipKit** tip — the framework-owned popover, so that no scenario has to hand-author the same recovery. The guard recognizes a tip by its dismiss scrim (`PopoverDismissRegion`) **and** its own container (`TipView`) together, because a plain `confirmationDialog` installs an identical scrim and must be left alone; an author who does write an `interrupts` entry for a tip keys it on `TipView` for the same reason (`TipView` is TipKit's own container, measured on both the SwiftUI and UIKit presentations). iOS only (inert elsewhere), and **off** by default: a tip is sometimes the very thing a scenario asserts on. CLI `--ios-tipkit-handling`/`--no-ios-tipkit-handling` overrides |
| `permissions` | dict | `{}` | Declarative OS permission state — `{ <service>: grant \| revoke }` — applied **before the app launches** ([below](#permissions-pre-launch-permission-state)) |
| `interrupts` | list | `[]` | Handlers for an interstitial screen that surfaces at an **unpredictable** point — each `{ condition, steps }`, checked opportunistically wherever the screen appears ([below](#interrupts-handling-unpredictable-interstitial-screens)) |

```yaml
- name: filter narrows the catalog
  preconditions:

## preconditions (environment setup)

Implementation: `scenario/models/scenario.py` `Preconditions`. The runner's `launch_driver` reads this to build
the launch sequence ([run-loop](run-loop.md#runner-the-run-pipeline)).

| Key | Type | Default | Description | Wired |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `erase` | bool | unset (inherits; off unless the config sets it) | Wipe the whole simulator (`simctl erase` — apps/data/settings) before the test. Off by default; `reinstall` keeps the app fresh without a full wipe, so set `true` only when a test needs a pristine device | ✅ |
| `reinstall` | `clean` \| `overwrite` | `clean` | How the app is reinstalled before each run when the app config sets `appPath`: `clean` = uninstall then install (fresh app + data); `overwrite` = install over the existing app (keeps its data) | ✅ |
| `launchArgs` | list[str] | `[]` | Launch arguments (appended to config's `launchArgs`) | ✅ |
| `launchEnv` | dict | `{}` | Launch env (injected via `SIMCTL_CHILD_*`; merged onto config's `launchEnv`) | ✅ |
| `deeplink` | str | none | Opened after launch via `simctl openurl` | ✅ |
| `locale` | str | none | Force the locale/language at launch (`-AppleLocale`/`-AppleLanguages`); overrides the app/config default | ✅ |
| `setup` | str | none | A reusable prelude scenario file (resolved relative to this scenario); its steps run before this scenario's own | ✅ |

> **launchEnv resolution order** is **config's `launchEnv` < preconditions' `launchEnv`** (the

## systemAlertHandling (the system-alert guard)

The iOS backend cannot see or tap **SpringBoard-level prompts** (a notification or App Tracking Transparency request, "Allow Paste"). These prompts cover the app and collapse its element tree, silently blocking a step. The **alert guard** clears them reactively. On the iOS XCUITest backend it takes a **deterministic native path** (BE-0315): reusing BE-0316's SpringBoard query, it reads which buttons the alert offers and taps a policy-named one — no screenshot and no model round trip, so it clears the common prompts in well under a tenth of a second and runs **without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**. Where the native path cannot act — a backend without the capability, or an alert whose button the policy cannot name — it falls back to the **vision guard** (`alerts.py`): a screenshot the model reads for where to tap ([details](recording.md#dismissing-system-alerts-automatically)). For a `wait` step (`for`/`settled`/`screenChanged`), the guard fires **mid-wait**: the native path polls SpringBoard on its own interval (default one second), and the vision fallback watches the already-polled screen for a collapsed tree (debounced, cooldown-limited, capped at two attempts per wait) — recovering before the wait's own timeout elapses, rather than waiting for the step to fail first (BE-0269).

It is **on by default** and fires **only when a step (or `expect`) is blocked, or — for a guarded `wait` — the native poll finds an alert (or the polled screen looks blocked)**, so a passing scenario does no extra work (a native query is not a model call). The vision fallback requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; without one it no-ops, but the native path still clears the prompts it can name. Use `systemAlertHandling` to change the behavior per scenario:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| (omitted) | on; tap the **least-destructive** button ("Not Now" / "Don't Allow" / "Cancel") |
| `systemAlertHandling: false` | off for this scenario |
| `systemAlertHandling: { rules: [{ prompt: notifications, choice: grant }] }` | on; answer a **named, covered prompt** by its own choice, regardless of which label it shares with another prompt |
| `systemAlertHandling: { instruction: ["Allow", "OK"] }` | on; the native path taps the first of these labels present on the alert — e.g. to **grant** a permission |
| `systemAlertHandling: { instruction: "tap Allow" }` | on; free-text the **vision** guard interprets (the native path, which needs an exact label, falls back to its default dismissive labels) |
| `systemAlertHandling: { pollInterval: 2 }` | on; poll the native presence query every 2 s instead of the one-second default |
| `systemAlertHandling: { enabled: false }` | off (the explicit object form of `false`) |

```yaml
- name: grant notification permission
  systemAlertHandling: { instruction: ["Allow"] }   # accept the prompt instead of dismissing it
  steps:
    - tap:  { id: sys.requestNotif }
    - wait: { for: { id: sys.notif.authorized }, timeout: 4 }   # the guard taps Allow, then this passes
```

Naming your own `instruction` labels also arms a second, in-tree path on iOS, for a prompt that is
**not** a SpringBoard alert at all. iOS raises its "Save Password" alert in the *app's own* process:
its buttons reach the element tree with a label and no identifier, and the SpringBoard query never
sees it, so only a tap in the tree can clear it. That tap is paced by the same `pollInterval` and
issued only on a poll whose own SpringBoard query just came back empty — because XCUITest resolves
whatever out-of-process alert is interrupting *before* it synthesizes an element interaction, and the
app's tree cannot see that alert. So when both prompts are up, the SpringBoard alert is answered
first, and the app-attached alert is cleared from the tree afterwards.

Which button an interrupting alert receives is your policy's decision too. XCUITest resolves such an
alert before the interaction it interrupts, and left alone answers it with the alert's own *default*
button — granting a permission your `rules` may have refused, with nothing in the run's report. The
runner therefore installs an interruption monitor that presses the button your `rules` and
`instruction` name, by the same discipline the native path applies, and the dismissal is reported as
an ordinary alert event. A prompt your policy names no button on is left to XCUITest, which is what
happened before this existed.
(real file: [`demos/showcase/scenarios/save_password_browser.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/save_password_browser.yaml))

The `instruction` is a list of candidate labels the native path resolves deterministically (it taps
the first label present on the alert, and only when exactly one button carries it); a bare string is
the legacy free-text form the vision guard interprets. The CLI `--system-alert-handling` /
`--no-system-alert-handling` flag **overrides every scenario** (otherwise the per-scenario default
applies); `--alert-instruction` sets a default button instruction that a scenario's own `instruction`
overrides.
(real file: [`demos/showcase/scenarios/permission.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/permission.yaml))

### Answering more than one prompt differently: `rules`

An ordered `instruction` list can already reach every combination of grant and deny across the
prompts the label table covers, but only through an ordering an author derives from which labels two
prompts happen to share — and the ordering that reads naturally can grant the very prompt a scenario
meant to refuse, silently. `rules` answers a specific covered prompt by name instead, reusing
`handleSystemAlert`'s own `prompt`/`choice` vocabulary:

```yaml
- name: onboarding — accept notifications, refuse tracking
  systemAlertHandling:
    rules:
      - prompt: notifications
        choice: grant
      - prompt: tracking
        choice: deny
    instruction: ["Not Now"]          # every alert no rule identifies
  steps:
    - tap:  { id: onboarding.start }
    - wait: { for: { id: home.title }, timeout: 10 }
```

The guard identifies which alert is on screen from a rule's prompt — both its accepting and refusing
labels, resolved for the run's locale, must be present on the alert — not from the order rules
appear in; two rules naming the same prompt fail at parse time. `rules` is checked before
`instruction`, which stays the catch-all for whatever prompt no rule names, so the two fields
compose rather than exclude each other.

`rules` steers the **deterministic native path only**. An alert no rule identifies — one outside the
label table, a surface the SpringBoard query cannot enumerate, or any alert at all on a backend
without the native path — reaches the AI-vision fallback, and the rules tell that fallback nothing:
a rule's label is another prompt's answer, so handing it over would push the model to accept a prompt
the scenario never named. Give the guard an `instruction` for anything you want the fallback to act
on; with rules alone it keeps its own least-destructive default.

This reactive guard and the proactive `handleSystemAlert` step below now share the *same* native
SpringBoard mechanism (BE-0316's query + tap); they differ only in *when* they fire — the guard
automatically wherever a prompt surfaces, the step at the one point an author places it.

> **Renamed from `alertHandling`, which itself renamed `dismissAlerts`.** The field and its CLI flag
> were renamed to `systemAlertHandling` / `--system-alert-handling` so the reactive guard's setting
> names "system alert" explicitly, pairing with the `handleSystemAlert` step below.

> The old `alertHandling` / `dismissAlerts` keys and `--alert-handling` / `--dismiss-alerts` flags

## handleSystemAlert (the deterministic system-alert step)

`systemAlertHandling` above is a **reactive guard**: it fires automatically wherever a prompt surfaces.
`handleSystemAlert` is its proactive counterpart — an explicit,
**deterministic step** the author places at the exact point a prompt is expected, which taps the
prompt's button by a native accessibility query, with **no screenshot and no model**
([BE-0316](../roadmaps/BE-0316-ios-permission-alert-step/BE-0316-ios-permission-alert-step.md)). Reach
for it to test a request-and-grant flow itself: fire the OS permission request, then grant or deny the
prompt that follows, deterministically.

```yaml
- name: grant the notification prompt mid-flow
  steps:
    - tap: { id: perm.requestNotif }                              # fires the OS permission request
    - handleSystemAlert: { sel: { label: "Allow" }, timeout: 5 }  # tap the prompt's button by label
    - wait: { for: { id: perm.notif.authorized }, timeout: 5 }    # request granted, app state updates
```

To dismiss the prompt rather than accept it, target the dismissive button
(`handleSystemAlert: { sel: { label: "Don't Allow" }, timeout: 5 }`).

- **`sel` is label-based only.** A SpringBoard alert button carries no app-assigned identifier, trait,
  or value — only its visible text — so `sel` accepts `label` / `labelMatches` / `index` and rejects
  `id` / `idMatches` / `traits` / `value` / `within` at parse time.
- **The label a run must match is the one the target's [`locale`](configuration.md#config-layering-defaults--targets)
  renders.** SpringBoard owns the prompt, so it used to render in whatever system language the
  Simulator happened to carry — making `label: "Allow"` work by accident on an English machine and
  fail on a Japanese one. A run now pins the Simulator's own system language to that `locale` before
  the app launches, so `label` / `labelMatches` resolve identically on CI, on a teammate's Mac, and on
  a contributor's Simulator alike
  ([BE-0320](../roadmaps/BE-0320-ios-system-alert-locale-determinism/BE-0320-ios-system-alert-locale-determinism.md)).
- **`timeout` is required**, exactly as for `wait`: a condition wait for the prompt needs an explicit
  bound. The step waits the prompt in, then taps — no fixed sleep.
- **Fail-fast on zero or many.** No prompt within `timeout` fails the step; more than one button
  matching the label fails as ambiguous **unless** `index` selects the nth — the same rule every
  [selector](selectors.md) follows, applied to the alert's buttons.
- **iOS (XCUITest) only.** Only that backend declares the capability, so a scenario naming
  `handleSystemAlert` against the Android or web backend fails **preflight**, before any device work.
  Android surfaces a system dialog in its ordinary element tree, so a plain `tap` reaches it there;
  the web backend has no OS-level prompt at all.

When to reach for `handleSystemAlert` versus the two alert fields it stands beside:

| Field | For | Timing | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `permissions` | an OS permission prompt you can avoid outright | pre-launch, before the app starts | deterministic device mutation |
| `handleSystemAlert` | a **known** mid-flow prompt you mean to tap | an explicit step where you place it | deterministic (native accessibility tap) |
| `systemAlertHandling` | an **unexpected** out-of-process prompt the tree cannot see | reactive, when a step or wait is blocked | native SpringBoard query on XCUITest (no model, reusing BE-0316); AI-vision fallback |

### Naming the intent instead of the text

For the prompts `permissions` cannot pre-answer — notification authorization, which is not a
TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) service; App Tracking Transparency (ATT), which has no
`simctl` toggle at all; and the cross-process paste consent, which iOS records as
`kTCCServicePasteboard` yet exposes through no `simctl` toggle either
([BE-0369](../roadmaps/BE-0369-ios-paste-consent-prompt-choice/BE-0369-ios-paste-consent-prompt-choice.md))
— the step takes a `prompt` and a `choice` in place of `sel`, and the run
resolves the label the pinned `locale` renders
([BE-0320](../roadmaps/BE-0320-ios-system-alert-locale-determinism/BE-0320-ios-system-alert-locale-determinism.md)):

```yaml
- handleSystemAlert: { prompt: notifications, choice: grant, timeout: 5 }
```

`prompt` is `notifications`, `tracking`, or `paste`; `choice` is `grant` or `deny`. One step names the
button by its meaning, so the same file grants the prompt under `en_US` and under `ja_JP` without an
author transcribing either language's text — worth having even for English alone, whose deny buttons
spell their apostrophe typographically (`Don’t Allow`, `Don’t Allow Paste`), not as the ASCII
character a hand-typed label carries.

A locale whose language the lookup does not cover (today: English and Japanese) fails the step
loudly, naming what is covered, rather than tapping a guessed button. Every other alert keeps naming
its button through `sel`, unchanged.

Two limits are worth knowing before reaching for it:

- **The Simulator only.** The pin is a `simctl` operation, so a target on `xcuitest.deviceType:
  device` runs against whatever system language the physical device carries — the intent form would
  resolve a label nothing guarantees is on screen. Name the button with `sel.label` there.
- **The reactive guard's default labels are still English.** `systemAlertHandling`'s built-in
  dismissive labels (`Don't Allow`, `Not Now`, `Cancel`, …) are literal English text, so under a
  non-English `locale` the native path finds no match and falls back to the AI-vision guard. For the
  prompts the label table covers, a `rules` entry (above) resolves its labels for the pinned
  language and keeps the guard deterministic; give it an explicit `instruction` list for any other
  prompt.

(real files:
[`demos/showcase/scenarios/permission_system_alert.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/permission_system_alert.yaml),
[`demos/showcase/scenarios/paste_system_alert.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/paste_system_alert.yaml))

## permissions (pre-launch permission state)

`systemAlertHandling` reacts to a permission prompt only *after* it appears, and only by tapping it —
useful when the prompt is unexpected, but it cannot **revoke** a permission or guarantee the app
starts from a known state. When the permission is known ahead of time, `permissions` sets it
**before the app process starts**, so the prompt never appears at all: a deterministic,
machine-checkable device mutation with no model call
([BE-0276](../roadmaps/BE-0276-scenario-permission-state/BE-0276-scenario-permission-state.md)).

```yaml
- name: profile — camera already granted
  permissions:
    camera: grant
    location: grant
    contacts: revoke
  steps:
    - tap: { id: profile.avatar.upload }   # no camera-permission prompt — already granted
```

Each entry is `<service>: grant | revoke`, where `<service>` is one of a small backend-agnostic
vocabulary: `location`, `camera`, `microphone`, `contacts`, `photos`, `calendar`, `notifications`.
Each backend maps a service to its own native mechanism:

- **iOS** drives `simctl privacy <udid> <grant|revoke> <tcc-service> <bundle>` — the same TCC
  (Transparency, Consent, and Control) database SpringBoard's permission prompts read.
- **Android** drives `pm grant` / `pm revoke`, reusing the plumbing behind the config-level
  `grantPermissions` list ([drivers](drivers.md)); a scenario's `permissions` layers on top of that
  config-level default and can revoke what it grants.

**iOS has no TCC service for `notifications`** (iOS notification authorization is not part of
TCC), so a scenario naming `notifications` on an iOS target fails **preflight** — before any device
work, naming the unsupported capability; `systemAlertHandling` remains the reactive path for that one
prompt. Android's `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` *is* a runtime permission (API 33+), so Android supports the
whole vocabulary. Every other unsupported combination (a service unsupported on the chosen backend)
fails preflight the same way, named individually.

`permissions` has no app-level XCUITest / Espresso equivalent, so `codegen` emits a labeled
`// TODO` per service rather than generating code for it — bajutsu applies the field itself, before
the generated test's own launch step.

## interrupts (handling unpredictable interstitial screens)

An `if` step ([below](#conditional-steps-if)) checks its condition at **one point** in the step
sequence — the right tool when you know exactly which step precedes the screen you are branching on.
It is the wrong tool when a screen's appearance is not tied to any one step: an onboarding overlay, a
tutorial, or an in-tree permission prompt can each surface a few steps earlier or later than
expected, or not at all, depending on account state, network timing, or an A/B cohort. A single `if`
only catches the screen when it appears exactly where the `if` sits; every other timing slips through
and fails the rest of the scenario against a screen it was not written to expect.

`interrupts` handles that case. Each entry names a `condition` — the same assertion DSL `if` uses —
and the `steps` that clear the screen. The runner checks each entry **opportunistically**, wherever in
the sequence the screen happens to appear, and runs the entry's `steps` when the condition matches.
That check is free where it rides a tree already read for this step — a `wait`'s poll tick, or
the fresh `before` a `screenChanged`-policy step reads when it has no carried-over tree to reuse.
Every other non-`wait` step pays one extra `driver.query()`, including a `screenChanged`-policy step
whose `before` is the previous step's carried-over tree (BE-0234), which the guard re-reads rather
than trust as current. After the handler runs, the interrupted step resumes where it
left off — a `wait` keeps polling toward its original timeout, an act step takes its action — so an
author no longer has to predict the one spot to place an `if`.

```yaml
# config.yaml — an app-wide default: this app's onboarding screen, on every scenario
targets:
  myapp:
    interrupts:
      - condition: { exists: { id: onboarding.skip } }
        steps:
          - tap: { id: onboarding.skip }
```

```yaml
# scenario.yaml — this scenario's own addition, appended to the config-level list
- name: log in
  interrupts:
    - condition: { exists: { id: att.dialog } }   # App Tracking Transparency prompt
      steps:
        - tap: { id: att.allow }
  steps:
    - tap:  { id: login.button }
    - wait: { for: { id: home.title }, timeout: 10 }   # an interstitial mid-flow is cleared, then this passes
```

An `interrupts` list set at the **config** level (`targets.<name>.interrupts`) is an app-wide
default; a scenario's own `interrupts` is **appended** to it, config entries checked first — the
same config-then-scenario layering `systemAlertHandling` follows. An entry's `steps` share the
enclosing scenario's `vars.*` bindings, exactly as `if`'s branches do. A handler may itself `use` a
[component](#reuse-data-and-tags), which expands before the run. A config-level entry may not: a
target config never goes through component expansion. A `use` under `targets.<name>.interrupts`
fails the config load. Inline the steps there, or move the handler to the scenario. If a handler's
own `steps` never clear its `condition` (a broken selector, a screen that re-renders identically),
the entry fires only a small bounded number of times per step and then the step falls back to its
ordinary outcome (pass, fail, or timeout) — a mis-set entry fails the step cleanly rather than
hanging the run.

The check is the deterministic assertion DSL, never a model call, so `interrupts` adds no AI to the
`run` verdict. That is the difference from `systemAlertHandling`: the alert guard is the vision path
reserved for out-of-process system prompts the accessibility tree **cannot see**, while `interrupts`
handles a screen the tree **can** see with a machine-checkable condition. When to reach for which:

| Field | For | Timing | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `if` | a screen at a **known** point in the sequence | one scripted check | deterministic (assertion DSL) |
| `interrupts` | a screen at an **unpredictable** point, visible in the tree | checked opportunistically throughout | deterministic (assertion DSL) |
| `handleSystemAlert` | a **known** out-of-process prompt you mean to tap mid-flow | an explicit step where you place it | deterministic (native accessibility tap) |
| `systemAlertHandling` | an **unexpected** out-of-process prompt the tree cannot see | reactive, when a step or wait is blocked | native SpringBoard query on XCUITest (no model, reusing BE-0316); AI-vision fallback |
| `permissions` | an OS permission prompt you can avoid outright | pre-launch, before the app starts | deterministic device mutation |

No native XCUITest / Espresso / Playwright construct maps onto "check this condition opportunistically
throughout the whole test," so `codegen` emits a labeled `// TODO` naming the field and each
configured condition rather than generating code for it — `bajutsu run` is the faithful path.

## `before` / `after` (setup and teardown phases)

`preconditions.setup` ([above](#preconditions-environment-setup)) names a prelude scenario file, and
the runner prepends that prelude's steps onto this scenario's own `steps` before the run starts. The
prelude then runs indistinguishably from the scenario's own steps: the report lists them in one
numbered sequence, and a prelude failure surfaces as an ordinary step failure with no marker showing
it came from setup. Teardown has no mechanism at all. The only place to put cleanup is the tail of
`steps`, and the step loop breaks on the first failure ([the run loop](run-loop.md)), so a trailing
cleanup step runs only when every preceding step already passed — exactly the run that needed
cleanup least. A scenario that signs up a test user, then hits a broken button three steps later,
leaves that user behind.

`before` and `after` close both gaps. `before` is an ordered list of steps that runs first, reported
as its own section, and a failure there aborts the scenario before `steps` and `expect` run at all.
`after` is a list of rules, each pairing an outcome — `always`, `success`, or `error` — with the
steps to run for that outcome. The runner evaluates the rules once the scenario's verdict exists,
and reaches the phase on every path out of `steps`, the failing path included. Both fields reuse the
ordinary step grammar and the ordinary assertion DSL, so a hook's steps are exactly as
machine-checkable as the scenario's own, and both share the run's `${vars.*}` bindings
([runtime variables](#runtime-variables-vars)).

```yaml
- name: sign up, then release the account
  before:
    # the seed endpoint returns the new user's bare id as its response body
    - http: { method: POST, url: "https://api.test/users", saveBody: userId }
  steps:
    - tap:  { id: login.button }
    - type: { text: "${vars.userId}", into: { id: login.username } }
  after:
    - on: always
      steps:
        - tap: { id: session.logout }
    - on: success
      steps:
        - http: { method: DELETE, url: "https://api.test/users/${vars.userId}" }
    - on: error
      steps:
        - http: { method: POST, url: "https://api.test/diagnostics", body: '{"failed":true}' }
```

(real file: [`demos/showcase/scenarios/before_after.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/before_after.yaml))

More than one rule may carry the same `on` value, and rules composing that way run in declaration
order — the same way two `capturePolicy` rules may share a trigger. A rule whose own steps fail does
not stop the phase: the remaining rules still run, because skipping the rest of the cleanup is the
outcome teardown exists to avoid. What that failure does to the run's verdict depends on where the
run already stood. On a run that was passing, the failing rule becomes the failure
(`after: step 0 (tap): …`). On a run that had already failed, the failing rule is appended behind
the original failure instead of replacing it, so the reason a reader sees first is still the original
cause rather than a symptom of the cleanup it triggered.

A cancelled run (`SIGTERM`, the `serve` Web UI's Cancel button) reaches the phase too, dispatching
`after` as an `error` outcome, and the cleanup rules get a bounded slice of the cancellation grace
window to run in. Once that slice is spent, the remaining rules are abandoned so the shutdown tail
that writes the report still fits inside the window.

### Both fields at the target-config level

`targets.<name>.before` and `targets.<name>.after` take the same shapes as an app-wide default, and
the two merge in opposite orders:

| Field | Merge order | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `before` | config, then scenario | The app-wide prelude seeds the state this scenario's own setup then builds on — the same config-then-scenario layering `interrupts` follows |
| `after` | scenario, then config | This scenario releases what it created before the app-wide teardown closes around it, the last-acquired-first-released order a fixture-based teardown pair gives |

`targets.<name>.before` does not replace `targets.<name>.setup`: only `before` is its own report
phase, and a `before` phase runs ahead of the prelude that `setup` splices onto `steps`. A `before`
step therefore must not depend on a screen the prelude reaches.

### When to reach for which

Three fields sit near this ground, and each answers a different question:

| Field | Runs | Reported as | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `before` / `after` | as its own phase, before `steps` / after the verdict | its own Before / After block | setup and teardown the reader must be able to tell apart from the scenario under test |
| `preconditions.setup` | spliced onto the front of `steps` | more numbered steps | a reusable prelude shared by several scenarios, where no separation is wanted |
| `capturePolicy` | throughout the step loop, per step | evidence attached to a step | capturing extra evidence when a step fails, not running steps |

`capturePolicy`'s `on: { result: error }` trigger and an `after` rule's `on: error` share the word
`error` for the same idea, at two scales: a `capturePolicy` trigger fires for one failed step,
wherever in the run it happened, while an `after` rule fires once, for the whole scenario's verdict.

### What `codegen` emits

`before` needs no framework construct: `codegen` emits its steps inline at the top of the generated
test body under a `// before` divider, which is exactly the phase's meaning — they run first, and a
failure aborts what follows. `after` needs one, and each target reaches it differently. Playwright and
UI Automator wrap the test body in `try` / `catch` / `finally`, since an assertion on either target
throws, so the `catch` sees the very failure the verdict would have been. XCUITest registers a single
`addTeardownBlock` instead, because `XCTAssert` records a failure rather than throwing, and reads the
outcome from `testRun?.hasSucceeded` ([codegen](codegen.md)).

## Selectors (addressing an element)

A selector identifies **which element** to act on or assert against. Provide one or more fields; multiple fields are **AND**-ed (all must hold), and at least one is required. How a selector resolves to exactly one element, and why an ambiguous selector fails instead of picking the first match, is covered in [selectors](selectors.md). The formal shape is in [dsl-grammar](dsl-grammar.md#2-grammar-at-a-glance).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | str \| list[str] | Exact `accessibilityIdentifier` — **first choice** (stable, non-localized). A list is an **OR** of candidates: the element's id must equal *any* one |
| `idMatches` | str \| list[str] | Glob over the id (e.g. `"list.row.*"`; assumes multiple matches). A list matches if the id matches *any* glob |
| `label` | str | Exact `accessibilityLabel` (visible text) — auxiliary / disambiguation |
| `labelMatches` | str | Regex / substring over the label (`re.search`) |
| `traits` | list[str] | Narrow by accessibility trait (subset test, e.g. `[button]`) |
| `value` | str | Exact accessibility value |
| `within` | Selector | Scope to a container — the match must sit inside an element the nested selector resolves to (nestable) |
| `index` | int | Pick the k-th of multiple matches (negatives allowed) — last resort, order-sensitive |

```yaml
- tap: { id: counter.increment }                               # by id (recommended)
- tap: { id: [stable.refresh, stable_refresh] }                # OR of id candidates (see below)
- tap: { label: "Delete" }                                     # by visible label (e.g. an alert button)
- tap: { id: row.action, within: { id: list.row.3 } }          # scoped to a container's subtree
- tap: { labelMatches: "^Item ", traits: [button], index: 0 }  # first matching button, fields AND-ed
```

> Prefer `id`. For a set of elements (count / existence) use `idMatches`. Use `index` only as a last resort — it breaks when order changes. Full resolution semantics: [selectors](selectors.md).

### Cross-platform ids: a candidate list (BE-0221)

A scenario is shared across platforms only to the extent its selectors are by `id`, and the driver decides which app-side attribute satisfies that `id`. But some platforms can't reproduce the SPEC id **verbatim**: Android's `android:id` (the Views toolkit) allows neither `.` nor `-`, so `stable.refresh` surfaces as `stable_refresh` and `search.results-empty` as `search_results_empty`. To keep **one** scenario running unchanged everywhere, give `id` / `idMatches` a **list of candidates** and the match becomes an OR over them:

```yaml
- wait: { for: { id: [stable.refresh, stable_refresh] }, timeout: 10 }
- count: { sel: { idMatches: [stable.row.*, stable_row_*] }, equals: 5 }
```

The dotted form matches on iOS and Android Compose (which reproduce it verbatim); the underscore form matches on Android Views. Only one form is ever on screen for a given app, so the selection stays deterministic: if **both** candidate forms happened to be present at once, the selector is ambiguous and fails fast — an OR never turns a two-or-more match into a silent pick. The candidate list keeps the id convention **explicit in the scenario**, rather than a hidden driver-side `.`↔`_` rewrite that could conflate distinct ids. The showcase's shared scenarios use this so `showcase-swiftui` / `showcase-compose` / `showcase-views` all run the same files.

## Step grammar (`steps`)

Each step is **exactly one action** + optional modifiers (`capture:` / `name:`). Two or more
actions in one step is a validation error (`scenario/models/steps.py` `_one_action`).

| Action | Form | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tap` | `tap: <Selector>` | requires unique resolution (fails if ambiguous) |
| `tapPoint` | `tapPoint: { x: <frac>, y: <frac> }` | tap a normalized screen coordinate (0..1, top-left origin) instead of a selector — the bottom rung of the stability ladder, for a control the accessibility tree exposes as no addressable element (for example, a no-id tab-bar tab); `record`'s vision path emits it, and `run` replays it against the current screen size |
| `doubleTap` | `doubleTap: <Selector>` | two quick taps on the resolved element |
| `longPress` | `longPress: { sel: <Selector>, duration: <sec> }` | long press |
| `type` | `type: { text: "...", into?: <Selector>, submit?: <bool> }` | with `into`, focuses first |
| `clear` | `clear: { into: <Selector> }` | focus the field and remove its entire current content; web context raises |
| `delete` | `delete: { into: <Selector>, count: <int> }` | focus the field and delete `count` characters from the end (`count > 0`); web context raises |
| `select` | `select: { into: <Selector>, mode?: "all" }` | focus the field and select its content (`mode` default `all`); the web context raises — the iOS (XCUITest) backend supports it natively, and codegen emits the native equivalent |
| `copy` | `copy: {}` | copy the active selection to the clipboard; requires a prior `select`; the web context raises — the iOS (XCUITest) backend supports it natively |
| `selectOption` | `selectOption: { sel: <Selector>, option: "..." }` | set a web `<select>` to the option with this value; web only (iOS / Android raise) |
| `setPickerValue` | `setPickerValue: { sel: <Selector>, value: "..." }` | move a wheel-style picker (`UIPickerView`, a wheel-mode `UIDatePicker`) to the row with this value ([below](#setpickervalue)); iOS (XCUITest) only. `sel` addresses one wheel — a multi-component picker's siblings are separated by `within` / `traits` / `index`, one step each |
| `swipe` | `swipe: { on: <Selector>, direction: up\|down\|left\|right }` or `swipe: { from: [x,y], to: [x,y] }` | selector form and coordinate form cannot mix; the directional form **scrolls** |
| `drag` | `drag: { on: <Selector>, direction: up\|down\|left\|right, amount?: <frac> }` | a real pointer **drag** of the element (a handle / divider / slider), not a scroll |
| `scroll` | `scroll: { to: <Selector>, direction?: up\|down\|left\|right, within?: <Selector>, amount?: <frac>, maxScrolls?: <int> }` | scroll (non-inertially) until `to` is on-screen, or fail at a bound; `direction` is **scroll** direction (default `down`), the inverse of `swipe`'s |
| `back` | `back: {}` | navigate back one level, each backend using its platform-correct primitive — the Android system back key, the iOS OS-provided back button, or web history ([BE-0210](../roadmaps/BE-0210-android-actuation-fidelity/BE-0210-android-actuation-fidelity.md)) |
| `pinch` | `pinch: { sel: <Selector>, scale: <num> }` | two-finger magnify; `scale > 0` (`>1` zooms in, `<1` out) |
| `rotate` | `rotate: { sel: <Selector>, radians: <num> }` | two-finger rotation; `>0` is clockwise |
| `handleSystemAlert` | `handleSystemAlert: { sel: <Selector>, timeout: <sec> }` | tap a button on an iOS SpringBoard permission prompt, deterministically ([below](#handlesystemalert-the-deterministic-system-alert-step)); iOS (XCUITest) only. `sel` accepts only `label` / `labelMatches` / `index`, and resolves against the system language the run pins the Simulator to. In place of `sel`, `prompt: notifications\|tracking\|paste` + `choice: grant\|deny` names the button by meaning and lets the run resolve its label (BE-0320) |
| `wait` | `wait: { for\|until: ..., timeout: <sec> }` | condition wait (below) |
| `assert` | `assert: [ <Assertion>... ]` | mid-step verification |
| `relaunch` | `relaunch: { env?: {...}, args?: [...] }` | terminate + relaunch the app (re-applying launch env/args, plus the given overrides), then wait until ready |
| `setLocation` | `setLocation: { lat: <num>, lon: <num> }` | override the simulated GPS location (`simctl location set`) |
| `push` | `push: { payload: {...} }` | deliver a simulated push notification (`simctl push`) with this APNs (Apple Push Notification service) payload |
| `http` | `http: { method?, url, headers?, body?, status?, saveBody? }` | issue an HTTP request (test-data setup / webhook / API); checks `status`, stores the body as `${vars.<saveBody>}` |
| `totp` | `totp: { secret, into: { var } }` | generate an RFC 6238 time-based one-time password (2FA) locally into `${vars.<var>}` |
| `email` | `email: { match: { to?, subject?, subjectMatches? }, extract: { var, bodyMatches }, timeout }` | poll the configured mailbox until a matching message arrives, extract a code into `${vars.<var>}` |
| `generate` | `generate: { random\|datetime: {...}, into: { var } }` | compute a random or current-datetime value at run time into `${vars.<var>}` ([below](#generate-a-value-computed-at-run-time)) |
| `manual` | `manual: { label: "...", bypass?: "..." }` | a human takeover recorded during `record` (BE-0185); has no deterministic run-time equivalent, so it **fails loudly** at `run` time — never a silent pass |
| `background` | `background: {}` | send the app to the background (Home button) |
| `foreground` | `foreground: {}` | resume a backgrounded app (`simctl launch`, no settle sleep) |
| `clearKeychain` | `clearKeychain: {}` | reset the Simulator keychain (saved passwords / certificates) |
| `clearClipboard` | `clearClipboard: {}` | clear the Simulator pasteboard |
| `setClipboard` | `setClipboard: { text: "..." }` | seed the Simulator pasteboard for a paste flow |
| `overrideStatusBar` | `overrideStatusBar: { time?, batteryLevel?, batteryState?, cellularBars?, wifiBars? }` | override the status bar for deterministic screenshots |
| `clearStatusBar` | `clearStatusBar: {}` | remove status-bar overrides (restore the live bar) |
| `use` | `use: { component: <file>, with?: {...} }` | expand a reusable component's steps — a compile-time macro ([reuse](#reuse-data-and-tags)) |
| `web` | `web: { within: <Selector>, steps: [...] }` | enter a WebView's DOM: `within` resolves the host `WKWebView` natively, and the nested `steps` address its normalized DOM instead of the native tree ([below](#web-entering-a-webviews-dom)) |

Modifiers:

- `capture: [<token>...]` — evidence for this step only ([evidence](evidence.md#b-inline-evidence)).
- `name: <str>` — the step id (the evidence output directory name · report label). Defaults to `step<i>`.
- `from: <str>` — **provenance** ([below](#from-provenance)): the phrase this step was recorded from. Authoring metadata; `run` ignores it.

### `tap`

```yaml
- tap: { id: counter.increment }      # exact id (recommended)
- tap: { label: "Delete" }            # exact label (for an in-app alert etc. with no id)
```

### `type`

```yaml
- type: { text: "a@b.com", into: { id: auth.email } }   # focus, then type
- type: { text: "hello", submit: true }                 # submit appends a newline / confirm (uses current focus)
```

> Internally, when `into` is given, the target is `tap`ped before `type_text` (`orchestrator/actions/`
> `_do_action`).

### `selectOption`

```yaml
- selectOption: { sel: { id: nav.theme-picker }, option: midnight }   # set the <select> to the option whose value is "midnight"
```

For a native HTML `<select>`, whose dropdown is not part of the page's element tree, a coordinate
tap cannot switch the value deterministically. `selectOption` resolves the `<select>` through the
same unique-match core every action uses, then sets the option by its **value** (not its visible
label) and fires a `change` event, so the page reacts exactly as it would to a user's pick. The
value matches what a `value` assertion reads back from the `<select>`, so a selection is directly
assertable. `selectOption` is a web-only action — a `<select>` has no native counterpart on iOS or Android,
so those backends fail the step with a clear "unsupported action" reason rather than doing nothing.

### `setPickerValue`

```yaml
- setPickerValue:                                                # move the wheel to the "大学" row
    sel: { within: { id: form.school }, traits: [pickerWheel] }
    value: "大学"
```

A wheel-style picker — a `UIPickerView`, or a `UIDatePicker` switched to a wheel-only mode — is an
ordinary iOS form control, and `setPickerValue` is the only step that can set one. Its rows are not
separately addressable elements, so `tap`, which addresses a resolved handle, cannot land on a
specific one. The coordinate-driven steps fare no better: `swipe` / `drag` / `scroll` are bounded or
directional drags that can spin a wheel roughly toward a value but cannot guarantee stopping on it,
and `tapPoint` can only hit whatever row the wheel already shows. Asserting the result of any of
those would depend on a drag distance matching the row height by chance — the approximate action
Bajutsu rules out everywhere else. `setPickerValue` instead calls XCUITest's own
`adjust(toPickerWheelValue:)` on the element the selector already resolved, so it is handle-based
the way `tap` is rather than coordinate-based the way `swipe` is.

`sel` must resolve the wheel itself, which is seldom the element carrying the identifier. A
`UIPickerView` publishes its identifier on the picker, and exposes the wheel as a separate child.
A selector naming that identifier alone resolves the parent instead, and the step fails.
`adjust(toPickerWheelValue:)` raises on any element that is not itself a wheel. Pairing the
identifier with the `pickerWheel` trait, as above, reaches the child.

A value the wheel does not carry **fails the step**, naming the value, rather than leaving the wheel
wherever it stopped — so the following assertion tests the app, not the gesture.

A multi-component picker (a year wheel beside a month wheel) exposes each component as its own
`pickerWheel` element, and `sel` always addresses exactly one of them. Use the `within` / `traits` /
`index` fields every selector already carries, one step per component. Both the component order and
the row labels follow the locale the run pins. The example below assumes `ja_JP`, whose wheels read
year | month | day. Under the config default `en_US` the wheels read month | day | year, with rows
`May` and `2016`. `demos/showcase/scenarios/picker_wheel.yaml` pins no locale, and so reaches that
second layout:

```yaml
- setPickerValue:
    sel: { within: { id: form.birthdate }, traits: [pickerWheel], index: 0 }   # the year wheel
    value: "2016年"
- setPickerValue:
    sel: { within: { id: form.birthdate }, traits: [pickerWheel], index: 1 }   # the month wheel
    value: "5月"
```

`within` scopes by frame containment, so its container must be large enough to hold the wheels.
A wheel-mode `UIDatePicker` fails that test on its own. iOS lays the components out at their
intrinsic height, then clips them to the picker. Every component reports a frame taller than the
picker publishing it. A `within` naming the date picker then matches nothing at all. Put the
identifier on a surrounding container whose frame covers the components instead. The showcase screen
takes that route: `demos/showcase/ios/swiftui/Sources/PickerView.swift`. The screen groups the
caption, the wheel, and the mirror text under one identifier.

This also works around the `datePicker` classification gap ([selectors](selectors.md#normalized-traits-trait)):
a `UIDatePicker`'s own container element falls to `other`, but the step addresses the wheel children
underneath it, which are classified `pickerWheel`, so the gap never bites here.

`setPickerValue` is an iOS (XCUITest) action. A picker wheel has no counterpart on Android or the
web — a web `<select>` expresses the same intent, and [`selectOption`](#selectoption) sets that — so
those backends have no `pickerWheel` capability and the scenario is rejected at preflight, before any
device work starts, with the step's location named.

### `web` (entering a WebView's DOM)

```yaml
- web:
    within: { id: checkout.webview }
    steps:
      - tap: { id: pay.submit }
      - wait: { for: { id: pay.confirmation }, timeout: 10 }
```

`web` resolves `within` natively to exactly one `WKWebView` host. It then runs the nested `steps`
against the WebView's normalized DOM (`data-testid` → `Element.identifier`), not the app's native
accessibility tree — for a hybrid screen that embeds web content inside a native app
([BE-0037](../roadmaps/BE-0037-webview-hybrid-support/BE-0037-webview-hybrid-support.md)). Control
returns to the native driver once the block's steps finish. The nested steps share the enclosing
scenario's `vars.*` bindings, the same as `if`'s and `forEach`'s do, and `capture` / `extract`
modifiers are not allowed on the `web` step itself. The step needs a WebView bridge configured
(`BAJUTSU_WEBVIEW_PORT`); without one it fails cleanly rather than doing nothing. This first slice
supports `tap` / `tapPoint` / `doubleTap` / `type` / `wait` / `assert` inside the block. `longPress` /
`swipe` / `drag` / `clear` / `delete` / `select` / `copy` / `selectOption` / `scroll` / `back` /
`pinch` / `rotate` / `handleSystemAlert` / `setPickerValue` are not reachable there, and each fails
with a clear "not supported in web context" reason.

### `swipe`

```yaml
- swipe: { on: { id: comp.swipearea }, direction: left }   # frame center → a screen fraction in a direction (default 0.125)
- swipe: { from: [100, 400], to: [100, 200] }              # raw coordinates (last resort)
```

`{on,direction}` and `{from,to}` must be **exactly one or the other** (mixing or omitting a side
is a validation error).

The **directional** form means "scroll", and each backend realizes it with the primitive that
actually scrolls: a real OS drag on iOS / Android, and — since a mouse drag does not scroll a web
page — a wheel event (desktop) or a touch drag (a mobile [`deviceMode`](drivers.md#playwright-web))
on web (BE-0227). The **coordinate** form is a literal pointer drag for its own sake (a canvas / map
pan / drag handle), the same raw-drag last resort on every backend.

### `drag`

```yaml
- drag: { on: { id: replay.divider }, direction: right }             # drag a grabbed handle
- drag: { on: { id: volume.slider }, direction: up, amount: 0.3 }    # ... a fraction of the screen
```

`drag` is an element-anchored **pointer drag** — it grabs the element and moves it in a direction,
for a resize divider, a slider thumb, a reorder handle: any control you drag rather than scroll. It
shares `swipe`'s directional geometry (`amount` is a fraction of the screen, `0 < amount ≤ 1`;
omitted, a small default), but where a directional `swipe` **scrolls**, `drag` performs a genuine
pointer drag. The distinction only bites on web: there a directional `swipe` is a wheel scroll that
would leave a grabbed handle unmoved, so use `drag` for it; on iOS / Android a real OS drag both
scrolls and moves handles, so the two coincide.

### `scroll`

```yaml
- scroll: { to: { id: notice.row.20 } }                 # scroll down until the row appears, then …
- tap: { id: notice.row.20 }
- scroll: { to: { label: "Log out", traits: [button] }, # scroll a specific container …
            within: { id: settings.list }, maxScrolls: 25 }
- scroll: { to: { id: chart.point.7 }, amount: 0.2 }    # … in finer steps than the default
```

`scroll` brings an off-screen element into view: it scrolls one step, re-queries the tree, and stops
the moment `to` resolves with its frame's **center** on-screen — the point a following `tap` aims at,
so a target taller than the viewport still succeeds once its center is reached.

Ending the scrolled region — the whole screen, or the container `within` names — takes evidence.
`scroll` reports the end of the content, meaning the target is not in the region, only once two
consecutive reads *show* the content standing still: an element the loop watched move is still there,
has stopped, and belongs to the scrolling region rather than to chrome above it; or the region's bounds
cut nothing off, so no frame can be hiding motion; or, where the tree can show neither, the screen as
drawn did not change across the step either. A tree of plain rows meets the second on the first step,
so a typo in `to` fails at once there; a tree that reports a window or root view spanning the screen
never does, so the screen as drawn is what fails fast on those backends, one step later. Where no
evidence is available at all, `scroll` keeps stepping and reports at `maxScrolls` (default 15) that it
could not observe whether the region moved. That failure makes a different claim from the
list having ended, and the difference is real: Android reports an element's bounds clipped to the part
of it that is visible, so a row taller than the screen reports the same frame while content scrolls
behind it.

A step after which nothing that had been in view is on screen at all is the opposite error, because it
may have carried the target past the viewport. Partly on screen counts, so an ordinary step on a screen
showing one card at a time is not mistaken for it. `scroll` halves the step, scrolls back once to read
the span that passed, and — when even the smallest step it will take still leaves nothing behind —
fails naming the overshoot rather than reporting the target absent.

`amount` sets how far one step travels, as a fraction of the viewport, in the range greater than 0
and at most 1 — the same unit and the same range `swipe` and `drag` take for their own `amount`.
Omitted, a step covers 0.6 of the viewport. Lower `amount` for a screen the default step crosses too
coarsely to land on the target, and raise it for one that reveals so little per step that
`maxScrolls` runs out before the target appears. `amount` decides where the loop starts and nothing else: the
halving above still shrinks the step from wherever `amount` put it, and still stops at the same
floor, which does not move with `amount`. An `amount` at or below that floor leaves the halving
nothing to shrink, so the first step that overshoots fails the call outright, naming the step it
took.

A re-read, not a single query, settles whether a step moved the region. The re-read matters on
Android. There the accessibility tree arrives after the gesture has already moved the list. A read
taken meanwhile describes the pre-scroll screen, which looks like the end of the content. Confirming
costs Android's declared read budget, on the step that ends a failing `scroll`. Web and iOS pay
nothing, because their reads do not lag. `within` scopes the gesture (and every decision above) to one
scrollable container; omitted, the whole screen scrolls.

Use `scroll` to **reveal a target**, `swipe` for a **fixed gesture**, and `drag` to **move a grabbed
handle**. Each step is non-inertial: it advances a bounded, screen-relative distance and leaves no
momentum, so the same scenario reaches a target identically on a fast device and a slow CI emulator —
the determinism a hand-tuned `swipe` chain cannot guarantee. The distance a step travels is the
distance it asked for, on every backend: the driver conformance suite measures one step's realized
travel and fails a backend whose content carries on past the gesture's own endpoints. A step that
overshoots anyway is caught rather than assumed away, by the look-back above.

> **`scroll`'s `direction` is the direction the content moves, not the finger** — the inverse of
> `swipe`. `scroll: { direction: down }` reveals below-the-fold content (the driver swipes the finger
> *up*); `swipe: { direction: up }` is the finger going up. An author reaching for `scroll` thinks

### `doubleTap` / `pinch` / `rotate` (gestures)

```yaml
- doubleTap: { id: gest.doubletap }                    # two quick taps
- pinch:  { sel: { id: gest.pinch },  scale: 2.0 }     # >1 zooms in, 0<scale<1 zooms out
- rotate: { sel: { id: gest.rotate }, radians: 1.57 }  # >0 clockwise (radians)
```

`scale` must be **> 0** (a validation error otherwise). `pinch` / `rotate` require multi-touch, which the iOS (XCUITest) backend and the generated XCUITest (`pinch(withScale:)` / `rotate(_:)`) both provide; a backend without it fails with a "needs multiTouch" reason. `doubleTap` runs everywhere (two taps). (real files: [`demos/showcase/scenarios/gestures.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/gestures.yaml) for `doubleTap` / `longPress`, [`demos/showcase/scenarios/gestures_multitouch.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/gestures_multitouch.yaml) for `pinch` / `rotate`)

### `wait` (condition wait)

Fixed sleeps are not supported. **`timeout` is mandatory** (no infinite waits).

```yaml
- wait: { for: { id: home.title }, timeout: 5 }            # until an element appears
- wait: { until: { gone: { id: home.spinner } }, timeout: 15 }  # until an element disappears
- wait: { until: screenChanged, timeout: 5 }              # until query() changes
- wait: { until: settled, timeout: 3 }                    # until the screen stops changing
- wait: { until: { request: { method: GET, path: /items, status: 200 } }, timeout: 8 }  # until a matching request is observed
```

`for` and `until` are exclusive (only one). `until` is `screenChanged` / `settled` /
`{ gone: <Selector> }` / `{ request: <RequestMatch> }`. The `request` form polls the network
collector ([evidence](evidence.md), the `--network` run flag) until at least one observed exchange
matches (same matcher as the [`request` assertion](#request-network-assertion): `method` / `url` /
`urlMatches` / `path` / `pathMatches` / `status` / `bodyMatches`, all AND-ed; `count` raises the
threshold). The endpoint is pinned by `url`
(exact full URL) or `urlMatches` (regex/substring), or just `path`. Timeout handling differs by kind
([run-loop](run-loop.md#waits-condition-waits-only)): `for` / `gone` / `screenChanged` / `request`
time out = step failure; `settled` is a stabilization hint, so a timeout just proceeds with the
current screen (it does not fail).

### `assert` (mid-step verification)

Verification mid-step. The DSL is the same as `expect` (next section).

```yaml
- assert:
    - disabled: { id: auth.submit }
```

### `setLocation` / `push` (device control)

```yaml
- setLocation: { lat: 35.681, lon: 139.767 }              # simctl location set
- push: { payload: { aps: { alert: "You have mail" } } }  # simctl push (APNs payload)
```

Both drive the Simulator via `simctl` and need a per-device control channel, so they are unavailable on
the fake driver and in parallel runs — there the step fails cleanly (it does not crash). `push` delivers
its `payload` as the APNs JSON to the app under test.

### `http` (request, for test-data setup)

```yaml
- http: { method: POST, url: "https://api.test/seed", body: '{"n":1}', status: 200 }   # fails if status != 200
- http: { url: "https://api.test/token", saveBody: token }   # vars.token ← response body text
- assert:
    - exists: { id: home.title }
```

`http` issues the request from the runner over HTTP — it does **not** go through the UI driver — so a
`status` mismatch fails the step, and `saveBody` stores the response body text as `${vars.<name>}` for
later steps. Touching no device, it is the one device-independent action here.

### `totp` (two-factor one-time password)

```yaml
- totp: { secret: "${secrets.TOTP_SEED}", into: { var: code } }   # vars.code ← current 6-digit OTP
- type: { text: "${vars.code}", into: { id: auth.code } }
```

`totp` computes an [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) time-based one-time
password locally — from the shared `secret` (base32; keep it in `${secrets.*}`, not in the YAML) and
the current time — and stores the current code in `${vars.<var>}` for a later `type` / `assert`.
This automates a 2FA sign-in without a scripting escape hatch or an LLM: the value is a deterministic
function of the secret and the clock ([BE-0046](../roadmaps/BE-0046-otp-email-steps/BE-0046-otp-email-steps.md)).

### `email` (poll a mailbox for a received code)

```yaml
- email:
    match: { to: "test@example.com", subjectMatches: "verification" }   # which message to wait for
    extract: { var: code, bodyMatches: "[0-9]{6}" }                     # vars.code ← first capture group
    timeout: 30
- type: { text: "${vars.code}", into: { id: auth.otp } }
```

`email` waits for a 2FA / verification code delivered by email: it polls a generic HTTP mailbox
(configured under `targets.<name>.mailbox`, see [configuration](configuration.md#mailbox-the-email-step))
until a message that arrived **after the step started** satisfies `match`, then extracts the value
from its body by the `bodyMatches` regex (first capturing group, or the whole match) into
`${vars.<var>}`. The wait is a **condition wait with a mandatory `timeout`** (no fixed sleep): a
timeout, a matched message whose body the regex can't hit, or an unreachable / non-2xx mailbox is a
clean step failure — never a silent wrong value. Only mail newer than the step's start counts (keyed
on message id, so a stale code from an earlier run is never matched), and among new matches the
newest wins. Deterministic and LLM-free; the endpoint and credentials live in config-referenced
`${secrets.*}`, so the scenario stays app-agnostic ([BE-0046](../roadmaps/BE-0046-otp-email-steps/BE-0046-otp-email-steps.md)).

### `generate` (a value computed at run time)

```yaml
- generate: { random: { string: { length: 8, charset: alnum } }, into: { var: username } }
- type: { text: "${vars.username}", into: { id: signup.username } }

- generate: { random: { uuid: {} }, into: { var: orderRef } }        # a version-4 UUID
- generate: { random: { int: { min: 1, max: 100 } }, into: { var: quantity } }
- generate: { random: { float: { min: 0, max: 50, precision: 2 } }, into: { var: amount } }   # e.g. "12.30"

- generate: { datetime: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", offsetDays: 1 }, into: { var: tomorrow } }
- type: { text: "${vars.tomorrow}", into: { id: booking.date } }
```

`generate` computes a value in the runner and stores it as `${vars.<var>}`, so a scenario can supply
an input its author could not write as a literal — a username no earlier run has taken, tomorrow's
date on a booking form, a reference that collides with no other scenario's. Data-driven rows
([reuse](#reuse-data-and-tags)) supply a fixed table chosen in advance, and `extract` captures a
value the app already displays; neither invents a value the scenario did not already have
([BE-0377](../roadmaps/BE-0377-dynamic-value-generation/BE-0377-dynamic-value-generation.md)).

Exactly one generator kind produces the value. **`random`** draws a `string` (a `length` of
characters from a `charset` — `alnum` by default, or `alpha` / `numeric` / `hex`), an `int` in the
inclusive range `[min, max]`, a `float` in `[min, max]` rounded to an optional `precision` of decimal
places, or a version-4 `uuid`. **`datetime`** renders the current time as text: `format` takes a
`strftime` pattern (ISO 8601 to the second when omitted), the signed `offsetSeconds` /
`offsetMinutes` / `offsetHours` / `offsetDays` fields add together to shift it, and `timezone` takes
an Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) zone name such as `America/Los_Angeles`. The default
zone is UTC, so a scenario whose input must match a date the app renders in the device's own zone
names that zone explicitly; pinning the *device* to a zone is a separate concern
([BE-0158](../roadmaps/BE-0158-timezone-device-primitive/BE-0158-timezone-device-primitive.md)).

The flow is deterministic even though the value is not. A `generate` step the loader accepted always
executes and always succeeds — a generator draw or a clock read, no network and no model — and only
the produced value differs between runs, the same way `totp`'s time-derived code already does. A
`format` that cannot be rendered and a `timezone` that does not resolve fail the load, so no run
ever substitutes a different value for one mid-flight. The run records each produced value in the
manifest and the report, so a later failure shows which value the run actually used; a scenario that
must check a specific value captures it through `${vars.*}` and compares against that capture, not
against a literal it could not have known in advance. Every codegen target renders `generate` as a
labeled `// TODO`, because the step runs in the runner rather than the app.

### `manual`

A human takeover recorded during `record`.

```yaml
- manual: { label: "solve the login CAPTCHA" }                          # no deterministic equivalent (a real CAPTCHA)
- manual: { label: "grant Face ID", bypass: "device-control biometric match (BE-0052)" }   # names the bridge an author could wire
```

`record` emits a `manual` step when a blocker is an *operation* the AI cannot perform — a CAPTCHA, a
biometric prompt, a gesture the agent repeatedly fails to resolve. The human operates the live device
and hands control back (the `acted` handoff, [recording](recording.md#human-in-the-loop-handoff-be-0179));
the step records a marker of the observed transition, not the raw gesture. `bypass`, when set, names
the test-build flag or the device-control / device-state primitive (BE-0035 / BE-0052) an author could
wire to make the step replayable; omitted, it marks a takeover with no such equivalent (a real CAPTCHA).
Every codegen target renders it as a labeled `// TODO`. A `manual` step is **never a silent pass**: it
has no deterministic run-time equivalent, so at `run` time it fails loudly with `ManualStepRequired`,
surfacing `label` and the bypass hint (directives 1 and 2). Wiring the named `bypass` — then replacing
the `manual` step with the deterministic action — is the author's path to a replayable scenario ([BE-0185](../roadmaps/BE-0185-record-human-takeover-step/BE-0185-record-human-takeover-step.md)).

### Device & system control (iOS)

```yaml
- background: {}                                                        # Home button (backgrounds via SpringBoard, no terminate)
- foreground: {}                                                        # resume the backgrounded app (simctl launch)
- clearKeychain: {}                                                     # reset saved passwords / certificates
- clearClipboard: {}                                                    # clear the pasteboard
- setClipboard: { text: "COUPON123" }                                   # seed the pasteboard (paste flows)
- overrideStatusBar: { time: "9:41", batteryLevel: 100, wifiBars: 3 }   # freeze the status bar
- clearStatusBar: {}                                                    # restore the live status bar
```

Like `setLocation` / `push`, these drive the Simulator via `simctl`, so they need a per-device control
channel and fail cleanly on the fake driver / in parallel runs. `overrideStatusBar` is most useful right
before a screenshot or a `visual` assertion, to freeze the clock and signal bars for a stable image.
`background` / `foreground` are the two halves of a background/foreground transition; `foreground`
resumes the app without any settle sleep, so wait for a concrete element afterward if you need one.
`setClipboard` seeds the pasteboard for a paste flow ([BE-0052](../roadmaps/BE-0052-device-state-timezone-clipboard-shake/BE-0052-device-state-timezone-clipboard-shake.md)).

## Assertion DSL

Shared by `expect` (final verification) and `assert` (mid-step). Items in the list are all
**AND**-ed; one failure fails the step. The evaluation mechanics (element resolution, comparison)
are in [selectors](selectors.md#assertion-evaluation).

| Assertion | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `exists` | a matching element exists (`negate: true` checks absence) | `exists: { id: home.title }` / `exists: { id: settings.banner, negate: true }` |
| `value` | accessibility value match | `value: { sel: { id: counter.value }, equals: "2" }` |
| `label` | label exact / substring / regex | `label: { sel: { id: settings.status }, contains: "done" }` |
| `count` | number of matching elements | `count: { sel: { idMatches: "list.row.*" }, equals: 5 }` |
| `enabled` / `disabled` | actionable or not (the `notEnabled` trait) | `disabled: { id: auth.submit }` |
| `selected` | selected / toggled state (the `selected` trait) | `selected: { id: tab.home }` |
| `request` | a matching network exchange was observed (needs `--network`) | `request: { method: POST, path: /login, status: 200, count: 1 }` |
| `event` | an analytics / telemetry event was sent — endpoint + JSON body fields, with a count (needs `--network`) | `event: { url: "https://t.example.com/track", body: { name: purchase_completed }, count: { equals: 1 } }` |
| `requestSequence` | matchers were observed in this order (needs `--network`) | `requestSequence: [ { urlMatches: "/auth/refresh" }, { urlMatches: "/api/account" } ]` |
| `responseSchema` | a captured response body conforms to a JSON Schema (needs `--network`) | `responseSchema: { request: { urlMatches: "/api/items" }, schema: items.json }` |
| `visual` | the screen matches a baseline image (visual regression) | `visual: { baseline: home.png, threshold: 0.02 }` |
| `clipboard` | the device pasteboard matches (read back via `simctl pbpaste`) | `clipboard: { equals: "COUPON123" }` / `clipboard: { matches: "\\d{6}" }` |

- `exists` writes its selector **inline** (`{ id: ... }` directly). `negate` is optional.
- `value` / `label` take `sel:` + **exactly one** of `equals` / `contains` / `matches`.
- `count` takes `sel:` + **exactly one** of `equals` / `atLeast` / `atMost`.
- `enabled` / `disabled` / `selected` take a selector inline.
- `request` matches an **observed network exchange** ([details below](#request-network-assertion)); needs the `--network` run flag.
- `event` matches an **analytics / telemetry event the app sent** ([details below](#event-analytics-event-assertion)); needs the `--network` run flag.
- `requestSequence` checks a list of request matchers were **observed in order** ([details below](#requestsequence-ordered-requests)); needs the `--network` run flag.
- `responseSchema` validates a captured **response body against a JSON Schema** ([details below](#responseschema-json-schema-of-a-response)); needs the `--network` run flag.
- `visual` pixel-compares a screenshot against a baseline image ([details below](#visual-visual-regression)).
- `clipboard` reads the device pasteboard (`simctl pbpaste`) and checks **exactly one** of `equals` / `matches` (regex) — the read-back half of `setClipboard`, for verifying a "copy" action. It needs the per-device control channel, so it is unavailable on the fake driver / in parallel runs and fails cleanly there ([BE-0052](../roadmaps/BE-0052-device-state-timezone-clipboard-shake/BE-0052-device-state-timezone-clipboard-shake.md)).

> **Locale caveat**: string comparisons on `label`/`value` and assertions that look at visible
> text break under translation. Write these against config's fixed locale, and write the selector
> itself by `id`.

### `request` (network assertion)

`request` asserts that the run's network collector **observed a matching HTTP exchange** (needs the
`--network` run flag and BajutsuKit in the app). The same matcher backs the `until: { request: ... }`
wait and `mocks` (below). At least one match field is required; the listed fields are **AND**-ed.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `method` | str | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, …) |
| `url` | str | Exact full URL (the endpoint) |
| `urlMatches` | str | Regex / substring over the URL (query strings live here) |
| `path` | str | Exact path (query ignored) |
| `pathMatches` | str | Regex over the path |
| `status` | int | Response status code |
| `bodyMatches` | str | Regex / substring over the **request body** |
| `count` | int | Number of matching exchanges — **exact** for the assertion, a **lower bound** for the `wait` |

```yaml
- assert:
    - request: { method: POST, path: /login, status: 200, count: 1 }
    - request: { urlMatches: "/search", bodyMatches: "apple" }   # match on the request body
```

> `count` is **not** a match field — at least one of `method` / `url` / `urlMatches` / `path` /
> `pathMatches` / `status` / `bodyMatches` must be present. (real file:
> [`demos/showcase/scenarios/network_mock.yaml`](../demos/showcase/scenarios/network_mock.yaml))

### `event` (analytics event assertion)

`event` asserts on a behavior the screen never shows: an analytics / telemetry event the app **sent**
([BE-0048](../roadmaps/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions.md)).
It is a pure check over the same observed exchanges `request` reads (needs the `--network` run flag),
so the verdict stays machine-only — no LLM. It filters the timeline by the event's **endpoint** (the
same `method` / `url` / `urlMatches` / `path` / `pathMatches` matcher as `request`), then by structured
**request-body fields**, and checks how many exchanges survive against a count operator.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `method` / `url` / `urlMatches` / `path` / `pathMatches` | str | Endpoint matcher (AND-ed), same meaning as `request` |
| `body` | map | Each `key: value` must be present in the JSON request body and equal the value, compared as text (so `amount: "300"` matches the JSON number `300`; a JSON boolean / null matches `"true"` / `"false"` / `"null"`) |
| `count` | object | Expected multiplicity — **exactly one** of `equals` / `atLeast` / `atMost`. Omitted means **at least one** |

```yaml
expect:
  # the purchase event fired exactly once with the right amount
  - event:
      url: "https://t.example.com/track"
      body: { name: purchase_completed, amount: "300" }
      count: { equals: 1 }
```

> At least one of an endpoint field or `body` must be present, so an event always pins something. A
> non-JSON, non-object, or absent request body matches no `body` criterion (it fails rather than
> guessing). Body values support `${vars.*}` / `${secrets.*}` tokens like the rest of the DSL.

### `requestSequence` (ordered requests)

`requestSequence` asserts that several requests happened **in a given order** — e.g. a token refresh
*before* the protected call ([BE-0048](../roadmaps/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions.md)).
It is a pure check over the observed timeline (needs the `--network` run flag), so the verdict stays
machine-only. It takes a non-empty list of [`request` matchers](#request-network-assertion) (the same
fields) and matches them as an **ordered subsequence**: each matcher must match a distinct exchange at
a strictly later position than the previous one. Unrelated traffic **may interleave** between them, so
the check is robust to noise; listing the same matcher twice requires two occurrences in order.

```yaml
expect:
  - requestSequence:
      - { method: POST, urlMatches: ".*/auth/refresh" }
      - { method: GET,  urlMatches: ".*/api/account" }
```

> Each matcher uses the same fields as `request` (`method` / `url` / `urlMatches` / `path` /
> `pathMatches` / `status` / `bodyMatches`); a matcher's own `count` is ignored here, since the
> sequence's job is **order**. For a pure multiplicity check, use `request` with `count`.

### `responseSchema` (JSON Schema of a response)

`responseSchema` asserts that a captured **response body conforms to a JSON Schema** — a contract
check the screen can't express ([BE-0048](../roadmaps/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions/BE-0048-behavioral-protocol-assertions.md)).
It is a pure, deterministic check over the observed timeline plus a stored schema file (needs the
`--network` run flag), so the verdict stays machine-only. `request` selects the exchange (the same
matcher fields) whose response is validated; `schema` is a file path resolved within the target's
**schemas directory** (`--schemas` flag, config `targets.<name>.schemas`, or `schemas/` beside the
scenario). Validation uses the `jsonschema` library — install the `schema` extra
(`pip install bajutsu[schema]`).

```yaml
expect:
  - responseSchema:
      request: { method: GET, urlMatches: ".*/api/items" }
      schema: items.json        # resolved within the schemas dir
```

> It validates the **first** matching exchange's response. It fails (rather than guessing) when no
> exchange matches, the schema file is missing, the response has no body or isn't JSON, or the body
> doesn't conform. The schemas dir resolves like `--baselines` for `visual`.

### `visual` (visual regression)

```yaml
- assert:
    - visual: { baseline: "home.png", threshold: 0.02, exclude: [{ x: 0, y: 0, w: 390, h: 47 }] }
    - visual: { baseline: "detail.png", compare: pixelmatch, colorTolerance: 0.1, antialiasing: true }
    - visual: { baseline: "summary-card.png", element: { id: "summary-card" } }  # one element only
    - visual: { baseline: "home.png", exclude: [{ selector: { label: "last updated" } }] }  # mask by element
```

`visual` captures a screenshot and compares it against `baseline` (a PNG resolved inside the run's
baselines dir — `--baselines`, or `baselines/` beside the scenario).

The comparison engine is selectable via `compare` (BE-0165):

| Engine | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `exact` | Pixel-perfect — any channel difference counts as a changed pixel. | Yes (backward-compatible) |
| `pixelmatch` | Perceptual YIQ color distance with anti-aliasing detection. Tolerates sub-pixel rendering noise and one-pixel edge shifts. | No |

When `compare` is omitted, the engine falls back to the target's `visualCompare` config
(under `defaults:` or `targets.<name>`), and then to `exact`.

`threshold` is the allowed percentage of differing pixels (default `0.0` = exact match), shared
by all engines. `colorTolerance` (0–1, default `0.1`) sets the per-pixel perceptual color
tolerance for `pixelmatch`; `antialiasing` (default `true`) discounts anti-aliased pixels from
the diff. `exclude` masks regions before comparing, e.g. a status bar or a clock. Each entry is
either a rectangle in screenshot pixels (`{ x, y, w, h }`) **or** a `{ selector: <Selector> }`
that names an element to mask (BE-0171); the element is resolved to its frame at evaluation time.
A baseline is created or updated with the `approve` command
([cli](cli.md#approve)) or the `serve` UI; a missing baseline fails the assertion. Pair it with
`overrideStatusBar` to keep the clock / battery deterministic. Diffs are surfaced in
`report.html`; for `pixelmatch`, only the surviving (non-discounted) pixels appear in the diff.

**Element-scoped comparison (BE-0171).** By default `visual` compares the whole screen, so any
unrelated change (a banner, a list that grew a row) fails the check and churns the baseline. Give
`element: <Selector>` to compare **only that element**: the screenshot is cropped to the element's
frame and the baseline is that crop, so the check ignores everything outside it. The selector is
resolved with the usual unique-resolution rules — an **ambiguous selector fails immediately**
rather than cropping the first match, and a selector matching nothing fails too. `approve` promotes
an element-scoped baseline exactly as it does a whole-screen one (the baseline is simply a smaller
image).

**Selector-based masking (BE-0171).** A pixel rectangle in `exclude` drifts the moment the layout
reflows or the device resolution changes. Naming the element instead — `{ selector: { label:
"last updated" } }` — is stable across those changes: the element is resolved to its frame and
masked exactly as a rectangle is. A mask selector that matches nothing is a no-op (there is nothing
on screen to hide); an ambiguous one fails, consistent with the determinism rule. Selector masks
and rectangles can be mixed in one `exclude` list, and both work with an element-scoped comparison
(a mask inside the cropped element is translated into the crop's coordinates).

## Network mocks (deterministic stubs)

`mocks` makes a test independent of a live server: when an outgoing request matches, BajutsuKit returns
a canned response instead of hitting the network. Each mock is `{ match, respond }`.

- **`match`** reuses the **request-side** fields of the [request matcher](#request-network-assertion)
  (`method` / `url` / `urlMatches` / `path` / `pathMatches` / `bodyMatches`). `status` / `count` do
  **not** apply to a mock's `match`.
- **`respond`** is the canned reply: `status` (default `200`), `headers` (default `{}`), `body` (a
  string), `delayMs` (artificial latency). Omitting `respond` returns an empty `200`.

```yaml
- name: GET answered by a mock stub
  mocks:
    - match: { method: GET, urlMatches: "example.com" }
      respond:
        status: 418                       # real example.com returns 200; 418 proves the stub served it
        headers: { Content-Type: text/plain }
        body: "stubbed by bajutsu"
  steps:
    - tap:  { id: net.fetch }
    - wait: { until: { request: { method: GET, urlMatches: "example.com", status: 418 } }, timeout: 6 }
  expect:
    - request: { method: GET, urlMatches: "example.com", status: 418 }
```

Mocks are handed to BajutsuKit via the `BAJUTSU_MOCKS` env (`dump_mocks`, `scenario/serialize.py`). The formal
shape is in [dsl-grammar](dsl-grammar.md#2-grammar-at-a-glance).

## Reuse, data, and tags

A small templating and macro layer wraps the core grammar. It runs **at load time, before the deterministic run**, so the runner only ever sees plain, fully-expanded scenarios. The normative rules (expansion order, `${ns.key}` interpolation, depth limits) are in [dsl-grammar](dsl-grammar.md#6-the-templating--macro-layer). This section covers the authoring perspective.

### Components (`use` → reusable steps)

A **component** is a separate file containing a list of `params` and a list of `steps` that reference them as `${params.<name>}`. A `use` step invokes it, binding params via `with`. `use` is a **compile-time macro**: `expand_components` (`scenario/expand.py`) replaces it with the component's substituted steps before the run. Expansion is recursive — a component may itself `use` another, up to depth 25. It raises an error on a missing or unknown param, a residual `${params.*}` referencing something undeclared, or a reference cycle. No `use` step survives into the run, so determinism is unaffected. Expansion reaches a scenario's own `steps` and the recovery `steps` of each [`interrupts`](#interrupts-handling-unpredictable-interstitial-screens) entry.

```yaml
# login.component.yaml — a component file (a single mapping, loaded separately)
params: [user, pass]
steps:
  - type: { text: "${params.user}", into: { id: auth.user } }
  - type: { text: "${params.pass}", into: { id: auth.pass } }
  - tap:  { id: auth.submit }
```

```yaml
# in a scenario — expands to the three steps above with params substituted
steps:
  - use: { component: login.component.yaml, with: { user: alice, pass: hunter2 } }
  - tap: { id: home.tab }
```

### Data-driven scenarios (`data` / `dataFile`)

A scenario with `data` (inline rows) or `dataFile` (a CSV path — the two are **mutually exclusive**) is expanded into **one scenario per row**, substituting `${row.<column>}` (`expand_data`, `scenario/expand.py`). Each derived scenario is renamed `"<name> [row N: col=val, …]"` and keeps the original preconditions, so every row reinstalls the app fresh and inherits the template's `erase` / `reinstall`.

```yaml
- name: search returns a result
  data:
    - { q: dog, expect: "1 result" }
    - { q: cat, expect: "2 results" }
  steps:
    - type: { text: "${row.q}", into: { id: search.field }, submit: true }
  expect:
    - label: { sel: { id: home.status }, equals: "${row.expect}" }
```

> A string that is **exactly one token** (`"${row.qty}"`) takes the **raw** value (a number stays a
> number); a token **embedded** in a larger string is spliced in as text (`"item-${row.id}"`).

A CSV `dataFile` has a header row naming the columns; each subsequent row becomes one scenario.

> **Refs stay inside the suite.** A `use` component and a `dataFile` path resolve relative to the
> scenario file, and the resolved file must stay **within the suite root** (the scenarios dir the
> load started from). A ref that leaves it — an absolute path, a `../` chain that escapes the root,
> or a symlink pointing outside — is rejected with a clear error and never read, so a scenario cannot
> make the loader open a file outside its own tree ([BE-0174](../roadmaps/BE-0174-scenario-ref-path-containment/BE-0174-scenario-ref-path-containment.md)).
> A relative ref that stays inside the root keeps working — a sibling `components/shared.yaml`, or,
> from a scenario in a subdirectory, a `../shared.yaml` that climbs no higher than the root.

### Tags and selection

`tags` label a scenario; the CLI `--tag` / `--exclude` flags pick which scenarios run. A scenario is kept
when it carries at least one `--tag` (or none was given) **and** none of the `--exclude` tags —
`--exclude` wins over `--tag` (`select_scenarios`, `scenario/select.py`). Both flags accept a comma list.

```yaml
- name: checkout smoke
  tags: [smoke, checkout]
  steps:
    - tap: { id: cart.checkout }
```

```bash
uv run bajutsu run --target showcase-swiftui --tag smoke --exclude wip   # run @smoke, skip anything @wip (across the app's scenarios dir)
```

### Secrets (`${secrets.X}`)

Declare secret environment-variable names in config (`secrets: [API_TOKEN, ...]`). Each declared name `X` is resolved from the environment and substituted into the executed step **at action time** as `${secrets.X}`. The scenario file stores the **token**, never the value, and literal values are **auto-masked** in evidence, making secrets safe to commit and review. Unlike `${params.*}` / `${row.*}` (load-time expansion), this namespace is resolved by the run loop.

```yaml
# config declares: secrets: [API_TOKEN]
steps:
  - type: { text: "${secrets.API_TOKEN}", into: { id: auth.token } }   # real value typed; token kept in the report
```

### Runtime variables (`${vars.*}`)

A step's `extract` modifier captures a UI element's property into `vars.*` after the step
executes. Subsequent steps (and scenario-level `expect`) can reference the captured value
via `${vars.<name>}`.

```yaml
steps:
  - tap: { id: counter.inc }
    extract:
      count: { sel: { id: counter.value } }          # vars.count ← element's value (default)
      heading: { sel: { id: header }, prop: label }   # vars.heading ← element's label
  - assert:
      - value: { sel: { id: other.field }, equals: "${vars.count}" }
```

Each `extract` entry specifies a `sel` (selector, resolved via `resolve_unique`) and an
optional `prop` (`value` | `label` | `identifier`; default `value`). If the selector
cannot be uniquely resolved or the property is `None`, the step fails.

### Conditional steps (`if`)

A step can evaluate a condition (using the same assertion DSL) and branch:

```yaml
steps:
  - if:
      condition: { exists: { id: dialog.alert } }
      then:
        - tap: { id: dialog.dismiss }
      else:
        - tap: { id: home.start }
```

The condition is evaluated against the current element tree (with `${...}` interpolation).
If it passes, `then` steps run; otherwise `else` steps run (or nothing if `else` is omitted).
Nested steps share the same `vars.*` bindings as the enclosing scenario. `capture` and
`extract` modifiers are not allowed on `if` steps.

### Iterating over elements (`forEach`)

A step can iterate over all elements matching a selector:

```yaml
steps:
  - forEach:
      sel: { idMatches: "item.*" }
      as: current
      steps:
        - tap: { id: "${vars.current}" }
```

The element list is snapshotted once at loop start. Each matched element's `identifier` is
stored as `vars.<as>` for the nested steps. An element with no identifier fails the step.
Zero matches is a no-op (success). The selector supports `${...}` interpolation. `capture`
and `extract` modifiers are not allowed on `forEach` steps.

## capture token grammar

Shared by `capture:` (per-step) and `capturePolicy[].capture` (rules). The form is
`<kind>[.<modifier>]`.

- **Kinds**: `screenshot` / `elements` / `actionLog` / `deviceLog` / `network` / `video` / `appTrace` / `rawTree`
- **Modifiers**: `before` / `after` / `around` / `onError`

Validation is over the set of kinds and modifiers (`scenario/models/_base.py` `_validate_capture`). The
acquisition timing per kind, and which are captured, are in
[evidence](evidence.md#evidence-kinds-and-acquisition-timing).

## YAML caveat

PyYAML (YAML 1.1) resolves `on`/`off`/`yes`/`no` to booleans. To prevent the `capturePolicy`
trigger key `on:` from becoming `True`, Bajutsu's YAML loader (`_yaml.py`) treats **only
`true`/`false` as booleans** and keeps `on`/`off`/`yes`/`no` as strings.

## `from` (provenance)

`from:` records **which natural-language phrase a construct was recorded from** (BE-0044). It is an
optional string attached at four levels — the scenario (the original goal), each step, each `expect`
assertion, and each `capturePolicy` rule — so a reviewer can see *why* each part exists and judge
whether `record` normalized the intent faithfully.

```yaml
- name: open settings and reindex
  from: "Open settings, reindex, and confirm the normalization setting is gone"   # the original goal
  steps:
    - tap: { id: settings.open }
      from: "Open settings"
  expect:
    - exists: { label: "Normalization setting changed", negate: true }
      from: "The normalization setting is gone"
  capturePolicy:
    - on: { action: tap, idMatches: "*.submit" }
      capture: [screenshot.after, network]
      from: "Capture a screenshot and network log on every submit"
```

- **`record` (Tier 1, AI) is the only writer.** It fills `from:` while normalizing the goal into the
  structured scenario; a hand-authored scenario simply omits it (and a dumped scenario stays clean —
  `from:` is pruned when unset).
- **`run` (Tier 2) ignores it entirely** — provenance is authoring metadata, never read by the
  orchestrator, so it adds no AI to the gate and cannot affect pass/fail.
- **Grouping is emergent:** when one utterance produces several steps, they carry the **same** `from:`
  string; there is no span syntax. `lint` reports an advisory provenance-coverage figure (how many
  steps carry `from:`); it never fails a run.
- **Shown in `trace` and the report.** [`bajutsu trace`](cli.md#trace) prints each step's phrase
  inline (`← "<phrase>"`) and `report.html` shows it under the step, collapsing a run of the same
  phrase into one label — turning the timeline into a natural-language ↔ action map.
- The phrase is kept **verbatim** in whatever language the author wrote (not translated).

## Round-trip (load ⇄ dump)

- `load_scenarios(text) -> list[Scenario]`: YAML string → validated models.
- `dump_scenarios(scenarios) -> str`: models → YAML (pruning `None` / empty list / empty dict for
  readability).

`record`'s output goes through this `dump_scenarios`. The generated YAML reloads cleanly via
`load_scenarios`.
