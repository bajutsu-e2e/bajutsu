The whole design rests on one property: **the deterministic gate is cheap, runs anywhere, and
mirrors CI exactly.** This is what lets work fan out safely — every branch is independently
verifiable, so "green locally" reliably predicts "green in CI", and the test suite is a
regression net that catches one session breaking another's feature.

## The gate

```bash
make check        # ruff check . + mypy bajutsu + pytest -q
```

Same three steps as [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml). The Python core
needs no Simulator, so it runs on Linux in seconds. Run it before you call a change done and
again before you push. On-device E2E (macOS + Simulator) is a separate, heavier path and is
**not** part of this gate.

## One topic per branch

- Branch off `main`: `claude/<short-topic>` for agents, `<user>/<topic>` for humans.
- Keep each branch small and single-purpose. Small diffs merge fast and rarely conflict.
- Don't open a PR unless the human asks; push your branch and let them open it.

## Never push red

The tracked **pre-push hook** runs `make check` and refuses the push if anything fails:

```bash
make setup   # uv sync --group dev + wire the git hooks (run once on a fresh clone)
```

`core.hooksPath` is a per-clone local setting that clone/pull never carry over, so an existing
clone won't have it — but you don't need to remember: `make check` (and `make hooks`) re-wires it
every time, so the gate self-heals right before you push. Claude Code web sessions also get it
automatically via [`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`](../.claude/hooks/session-start.sh). In a real
emergency you can bypass with `git push --no-verify`, but the next CI run will still gate the PR.

The same `core.hooksPath` also wires a tracked **commit-msg hook**
([`.githooks/commit-msg`](../.githooks/commit-msg), BE-0069): it blocks a commit whose subject isn't
a scoped conventional subject (`type(scope): …`, or `docs: …`), catching the mechanical convention at
commit time instead of in review. It is deliberately narrow — merge / revert / fixup / squash commits
pass, and it no-ops when `uv` isn't on PATH; bypass a one-off with `git commit --no-verify`.

When you change behavior, change a test with it — the suite is the contract that protects every
other session from your change.

## Rebase early, integrate small conflicts

```bash
make preflight   # git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && make check, then a done-checklist
```

`make preflight` ([`scripts/preflight.sh`](../scripts/preflight.sh), BE-0069) is the run-it-early
version of the pre-push routine: it syncs, rebases onto `origin/main`, runs the gate, then prints
the "definition of done" reminder (both-language docs touched? a test changed with the behavior?
`Status` flipped if shipping?). It is **advisory and human-initiated** — the pre-push hook already
*gates* `make check`, so this is the do-it-early version a human runs before they think they are
done, not a second hard gate. Run it whenever; you don't need to remember the individual steps.

Rebasing frequently means you meet other sessions' merged work early, when conflicts are a line
or two — not at the end as a tangled merge.

`make hooks` also self-heals two local git settings that take the sting out of the conflicts that
remain (BE-0043), so you don't have to configure them by hand:

- a **`uv.lock` merge driver** ([`scripts/merge-uv-lock.sh`](../scripts/merge-uv-lock.sh), mapped via
  [`.gitattributes`](../.gitattributes)) that **regenerates the lockfile from `pyproject.toml`** on a
  conflict instead of line-merging resolver output. If `pyproject.toml` itself conflicts, `uv lock`
  fails and git leaves `uv.lock` conflicted — resolve `pyproject.toml` first, then re-merge.
- **`rerere`** (reuse recorded resolution), so a conflict you have resolved once replays
  automatically the next time the same conflict appears.

Like `core.hooksPath`, these are per-clone local git settings that clone/pull never carry over, so
`make check` / `make setup` re-wire them every time.

## Isolate concurrent sessions with worktrees

Two agents must never edit the same checkout. Give each session its own
[worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) + branch, all sharing one `.git`:

```bash
# from the main checkout
make worktree TOPIC=<topic>             # branch claude/<topic> at ../bajutsu-<topic>
make worktree TOPIC=<topic> PREFIX=<user>   # a human's <user>/<topic> branch
```

`make worktree` ([`scripts/worktree.sh`](../scripts/worktree.sh), BE-0069) does the whole recipe:
`git fetch origin`, `git worktree add ../bajutsu-<topic> -b claude/<topic> origin/main`, then
`make setup` in the new tree (deps + the self-healing git hooks). The branch prefix defaults to
`claude`; pass `PREFIX=<user>` for a human branch.

The `git fetch origin` is baked in and *not* optional: `origin/main` is a local tracking ref that
only advances when you fetch, so skipping it would branch the new worktree off whatever main
looked like last time — re-introducing conflicts that other sessions already merged away. The
command fetches first so that foot-gun cannot happen.

When the branch is merged (or abandoned), clean up:

```bash
git worktree remove ../bajutsu-<topic>
```

Generated and scratch output — `runs/`, `tmp/`, `.venv/`, build artifacts — is gitignored on
purpose; keep it out of commits so worktrees stay independent.

## Stay in your lane

Touch only the files your task needs. The architecture is layered (scenario → orchestrator →
driver → backend; see [architecture](architecture.md)), so most tasks live in one layer. If a
change must cut across many modules — e.g. altering the abstract **Driver API**, the scenario
**schema**, or a shared config shape — call it out up front so other sessions can steer clear of
that surface (or wait for it to land) instead of building on top of a moving target.

High-traffic shared surfaces to coordinate on:

| Surface | Files | Why it's shared |
|---|---|---|
| Driver API | [`bajutsu/drivers/base.py`](../bajutsu/drivers/base.py) | every backend + the orchestrator depend on it |
| Scenario schema | [`bajutsu/scenario.py`](../bajutsu/scenario.py) | the hub artifact; codegen/runner/report all read it |
| Config shape | [`bajutsu/config.py`](../bajutsu/config.py) | per-target layering every command resolves through |

## CI keeps the branches honest

CI runs the same gate on every PR and uses
`concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress`, so re-pushes to the same branch
supersede stale runs instead of piling up. Two PRs that each pass independently can still
conflict in behavior — the merge is where they meet, which is exactly why the deterministic test
suite (not an LLM, not a human eyeball) is the arbiter. Keep the suite meaningful and your branch
rebased, and parallel work composes.

## Naming GitHub Actions workflows and jobs

A workflow's `name:` and each job's `name:` are all a reviewer sees in the Actions tab and a PR's
checks list — the YAML behind them is a click away, so each name has to stand on its own. Name both
in one shape: a short plain-language phrase for what the check does, plus a parenthetical for the
tool or scope when that adds information — `E2E (Simulator)`, `Swift (BajutsuKit)`,
`Web E2E (Playwright)`, `Dependency audit (pip-audit)`. Never leave a bare single word (`docs`,
`build`, `deploy`) that only makes sense once you open the run. `e2e.yml` and `swift.yml` are the
canonical examples (BE-0122). A `name:` that itself contains a colon-space needs quoting so YAML
doesn't read it as a nested mapping — `name: "Roadmap: allocate BE IDs"`.

One constraint bounds any rename. A required status check's context is the **job's** `name:`
verbatim — not the workflow's — and `main`'s branch-protection ruleset pins a few of these by exact
string: `check` (`ci.yml`), `E2E` (`e2e.yml`), and `require two approvals for BE proposals`
(`roadmap-proposal-approvals.yml`). Renaming one of those job names without editing the ruleset's
`required_status_checks` in the same instant strands every open PR on a check that no longer
reports, silently blocking merges. Ruleset edits are out-of-repo admin state a normal PR can't
carry, so leave those three names as they are; a deliberate rename must be paired with a human admin
edit to the ruleset.

## Right-sizing the model and reasoning effort (BE-0103)

This repository is agent-driven, so a session's **model** and **reasoning effort** are a real,
recurring token cost. Match them to the task's cognitive load: pay for a capable model at high
effort where the work needs it, and downshift for mechanical chores. This is **advisory** — a human
can always upshift for a hard instance — and it never touches the deterministic `run` / CI gate,
which calls no model regardless of what a *development* session runs at.

The failure mode is asymmetric: over-provisioning wastes tokens invisibly (the output still looks
fine), while under-provisioning shows up loudly as a bad result. So the natural drift is toward
*always-max*, which is exactly the waste this convention removes — without downshifting so far that
quality suffers on the hard tasks.

### The task → capability matrix

This table is the single source of truth; the skill frontmatter (below) and the subagent guidance
reflect it. Tasks map to one of three tiers along two axes — model and reasoning effort:

| Tier | Model | Effort | Tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Heavy** | `opus` | high | Implementing a BE item (`implement-be`), non-trivial refactors, architecture / design decisions, debugging a failing gate |
| **Medium** | `sonnet` | moderate | Roadmap ideation / authoring (`ideation`), Japanese technical writing and translation review (`japanese-tech-writing`), PR review |
| **Light** | `haiku` | low or none | Roadmap index regeneration / promote, doc formatting and link fixes, mechanical renames, lockfile / format chores, drafting a first-pass translation before the medium-tier review |

The tier → model-id mapping lives only here, so re-pointing a tier at a new Claude model is a
one-line change in one place. The model ids above are Claude Code aliases (`opus` / `sonnet` /
`haiku`), which stay stable as the underlying model versions advance.

### Where the default applies itself: skill frontmatter

Each in-repo skill declares its tier as a `model:` field in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter, so the
harness picks the right model when the skill runs — nothing to remember, still overridable:

- [`implement-be`](../.claude/skills/implement-be/SKILL.md) → `opus` (Heavy)
- [`ideation`](../.claude/skills/ideation/SKILL.md) → `sonnet` (Medium)
- [`japanese-tech-writing`](../.claude/skills/japanese-tech-writing/SKILL.md) → `sonnet` (Medium)
- [`roadmap-filter`](../.claude/skills/roadmap-filter/SKILL.md) → `haiku` (Light) — a read-only
  survey of the roadmap by `Status` (BE-0162): it wraps `make roadmap-status STATUS="…"` so a
  session lists just the items in one status (e.g. every open `Proposal`), with each item's file
  path to open next, instead of reading the 700+-line `roadmaps/README.md` into context.

Most light-tier chores aren't skills, so that tier is otherwise reached interactively or by subagent
delegation, below — `roadmap-filter` is the exception, since its whole job is one light,
deterministic lookup. `tests/test_skill_models.py` checks that each skill's `model:` is a known,
valid id, so a typo fails the gate locally instead of silently falling back.

### Phases and subagent delegation

The frontmatter can't reach interactive and delegated work, so choose there by hand:

- **Phases within a session** — downshift (or `/fast`) for exploration, research, and mechanical
  chores; upshift for implementation and design. The `/model` and `/fast` controls switch model and
  effort mid-session.
- **Subagent delegation** — when spawning a subagent via the Agent tool, pass the `model` that
  matches the *delegated* task, not the driver's: a broad `Explore` fan-out or an index
  regeneration can run cheaper than the session driving it. This is also the only lever for the
  out-of-repo review plugins (`pr-review-toolkit`), whose frontmatter we don't own — set their model
  at spawn time.

Deliberately **not gate-enforced**: which model a session used isn't recoverable from the diff, and
hard-pinning would remove the human's judgment to upshift when a "light" task turns out hard. This
follows the same "procedures as commands, advisory not policy" precedent as the rest of the
contributor workflow ([BE-0069](../roadmaps/BE-0069-executable-contributor-guardrails/BE-0069-executable-contributor-guardrails.md)).

## Pull requests: title and body

Don't open the PR yourself unless the human asks (see [One topic per branch](#one-topic-per-branch));
push your branch and let them open it. But when you draft a PR — or write the title and body for a
human to open — follow the shape below. It is reverse-engineered from the PRs this repo already
merges, so matching it keeps the history uniform and a reviewer always finds the same things in the
same places. **The title and body are always in English**, whatever language the session ran in.

### Title

One scoped, [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) subject — the same line you
would write as the lead commit:

```
[BE-NNNN] type(scope): summary
```

- **`type(scope):`** — a conventional-commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `refactor`,
  `test`) and the area it touches (`run`, `web`, `codegen`, `audit`, `roadmap`, `hooks`, `ja`, …),
  e.g. `feat(audit):`, `fix(hooks):`, `docs(roadmap):`.
- **summary** — imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period; a single line a reviewer reads at a
  glance. A roadmap proposal reads `docs(roadmap): propose <the idea>`.
- **`[BE-NNNN]` prefix** — only when the PR is tied to a roadmap item, in brackets before the scoped
  subject (e.g. `[BE-0017] feat(mcp): add MCP server`). A PR with no roadmap item keeps the plain
  scoped subject. A PR that *introduces* a new roadmap item also keeps the plain scoped subject — it
  carries **no** `[BE-NNNN]` prefix, because the id is allocated on `main` after the merge (see
  [Roadmap items](#roadmap-items-be-ids-strict)).
- **CI enforces the title.** The `pr-title` workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`) runs
  `scripts/lint_pr.py --title-only` on every PR — and re-runs when the title is edited. It fails the
  check when the title is not a scoped conventional subject, and when the branch name encodes a
  roadmap id (`claude/be-0050-<slug>`) but the title doesn't lead with the matching `[BE-0050]`
  prefix (a missing or mismatched id). The branch — not the diff — is the authoritative id signal,
  so a copy-pasted `[BE-0046]` on a `be-0050` branch is caught.

### Body

The tracked [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is the canonical
form of this shape — GitHub pre-fills it into every new PR, and **when you (AI) draft a PR you follow
it**: fill the sections that apply and delete the rest. The recurring `## Prime-directive compliance`
and `## Verification` blocks it ships pre-filled are the canonical wording — trim them to what the
change bears on rather than re-inventing the phrasing. The rest of this section is the reference the
template's inline comments point back to.

Two parts are mandatory — `## Summary` and a verification statement — and the rest appear as the
change warrants, in the order below. Match the depth to the diff: a one-file fix is a short Summary
and the green numbers; a cross-cutting feature earns the full set. Write the prose the way these
sections already read in the merged PRs — present tense, describing what the change *is*, not a
narration of how you got there. Keep **bold** for the few nouns that carry the change, never whole
sentences. In the change list, follow the recurring `**path** — what it does, and why this seam`
shape: name the design choice, not just the edit.

The sections that recur, and what each carries:

- **`## Summary`** (mandatory) — one to three short paragraphs: what the PR does and *why it
  matters*, with the key nouns in **bold**. Open with the change itself, not its history. When the
  PR is one slice of a larger item, name the slice and say what merging it does to the item's
  `Status` (e.g. moves it to *In progress*).
- **`## What changed`** / **`## Changes`** — one bullet per file or component, the **path or
  component in bold**, then an em-dash and what it does *and why this seam* — the design choice, not
  just the edit. Mark new files `(new)`. Group by component, not by commit; the reviewer reads the
  result, not the path you took to it.
- **`## Prime-directive compliance`** — whenever the change touches tool behavior or the runtime.
  State it plainly: no model is consulted on the verdict, the `run` / CI gate stays deterministic,
  and per-target differences stay in config — a line per [prime
  directive](../CLAUDE.md#prime-directives-do-not-violate) the change bears on. A docs-only or
  infrastructure PR can say so in a sentence instead.
- **`## Scope`** (often *Scope (deferred to …)*) — what is deliberately **not** in this PR, so a
  reviewer never has to infer the boundary. For a slice of a larger item, list what later slices
  still owe.
- **`## Verification`** / **`## Testing`** / **`## Test plan`** (mandatory, in some form) —
  `make check` green with the concrete numbers it printed (`N passed, coverage X%`), and a sentence
  on what the new tests cover. Call out anything the gate *can't* exercise (a workflow's runtime, a
  Simulator-only path) so the reviewer knows what was and wasn't proven — accuracy here is the point,
  don't claim a path was tested when it wasn't.
- For a roadmap proposal: **`## Files`** (the bilingual pair) and **`## BE ID allocation`** (the
  `BE-XXXX` placeholder note — the workflow numbers it on `main` after the merge; don't hand-edit the
  number).
- **`## Notes`** — caveats, a related or competing open PR, an expected merge conflict and how to
  resolve it.

Close the body with reference-style links for the items you cited (`[BE-0049]: roadmaps/…`) and the
footer `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`. Reserve GitHub's
`> [!NOTE]` callouts for a caveat a reviewer must not miss.

A small fix needs only the two mandatory parts:

```markdown
## Summary

Follow-up to #189: `session-start.sh` could abort the hook — and the session — under `set -e`
when `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is unset. This makes the project-dir discovery best-effort.

## Verification

`shellcheck` clean; `make check` green (1059 passed, coverage 87.4%). Repro'd that the hook now
logs the skip and exits 0 instead of aborting.
```

A feature or roadmap-bearing PR fills the full shape:

```markdown
## Summary

The **<slice>** of [BE-NNNN]. <What it does and why it matters, key nouns in bold.> This moves
the item to **In progress**.

## What changed

- **`bajutsu/<file>.py` (new)** — <what it does, and why this seam>.
- **`bajutsu/<other>.py`** — <the change, and the design choice behind it>.
- **docs (en/ja)** — <what was documented>.

## Prime-directive compliance

No model is consulted on the verdict; the `run` / CI gate stays deterministic; per-target
differences stay in config.

## Scope (deferred to later BE-NNNN slices)

<What is deliberately not in this PR.>

## Verification

`make check` green: format-check / ruff / mypy (Success) / test (N passed, coverage X%). New
tests cover <…>.

The short form of these rules is in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Responding to PR review comments

Reviews get answered comment by comment, by **whoever owns the pull request — a human contributor
or an AI agent alike**. When a reviewer (Claude Code — the automated reviewer, see below — or a
human) leaves comments, keep working until every comment is resolved, then **reply to each comment
individually**. A single summary reply on the PR is not enough: each comment thread gets its own
reply, so the thread that raised a point is the thread that records its resolution.

Every reply states two things:

- **that the comment is addressed** — fixed in code, or consciously declined; and
- **the grounds for it** — the concrete change that resolves it (what you altered, and where —
  cite the commit or the file/line), or, when you make no change, the specific reason the comment
  does not apply.

A bare "done" or a 👍 is not a reply under this rule; the grounds are what let whoever later reads
the thread audit the resolution. Keep each reply short and factual — the point is evidence, not
narration.

When you are unsure how a comment should be handled — the fix is ambiguous, or it touches
something architecturally significant — ask rather than guess (an AI agent checks with the human
driving it; a human contributor checks with the reviewer or a maintainer), and leave that thread
open until it is decided.

### The automated reviewer (Claude Code, BE-0203)

Once the `claude-review` Environment has a provider credential (a Claude Code subscription token or
Amazon Bedrock role), every pull request is reviewed automatically by **Claude Code**, run from the
[`claude-review`](../.github/workflows/claude-review.yml) workflow: it reviews when a PR opens and
re-reviews on each push, running the built-in `/code-review --comment` skill against the
[`.github/claude-review-prompt.md`](../.github/claude-review-prompt.md) contract, and posts inline
line-level comments (with `suggestion` blocks where a fix is mechanical) plus a short summary. Until
a credential is provisioned the workflow is a dormant green no-op — it posts nothing and never
blocks — so no review appearing on a PR yet just means the Environment isn't configured. The
prompt points the reviewer at *this repository's* contract — the three
[prime directives](../CLAUDE.md#prime-directives-do-not-violate), the docstring standard, the
bilingual-docs rule, the BE-ID lifecycle — so it catches what a generic reviewer cannot.

It is **advisory, never a gate.** It is deliberately not a required status check, and its job result
is decoupled from its findings (a review that found issues is a *successful* review, so the job goes
red only on an infrastructure failure). The deterministic `check` / `E2E` gates remain the only
merge arbiters — this is a reviewer, not a judge (prime directive 1). Treat its comments exactly as
you would any reviewer's, under the reply rules above.

- **On demand.** Beyond the auto-review, write `@claude review` on a PR (or reply to a review
  thread) to request a fresh pass or a follow-up on a specific comment.
- **Forks.** A plain `pull_request` event from a fork does not expose secrets (by GitHub's design),
  so auto-review covers same-repo `claude/<topic>` / `<user>/<topic>` branches; a fork PR is
  reviewed on demand by a maintainer instead.
- **Migration off Copilot (manual, out-of-repo).** The workflow lands alongside Copilot's review so
  the two run in parallel and can be compared; once Claude Code's review has proven itself, a
  maintainer **disables Copilot's automatic review in the repository / organization settings**.
  That is admin state a PR cannot carry (the same shape as the branch-protection ruleset edits
  BE-0122 and BE-0089 call out), so it is an explicit manual step.

## Roadmap items: BE IDs (strict)

The roadmap is **one directory per item** under [`roadmaps/`](../roadmaps/README.md). Each item lives in
`roadmaps/<category>/BE-NNNN-<slug>/`, which holds the English file `BE-NNNN-<slug>.md` and its
Japanese version `BE-NNNN-<slug>-ja.md` (same ID and slug). **BE** stands for *Bajutsu Evolution* and `NNNN`
is a **zero-padded, 4-digit, monotonically increasing** ID. Every item lives directly under `roadmaps/`
in a flat layout: its path is fixed the moment its ID is allocated and never moves (BE-0159 retired the
per-`Status` folders BE-0078 introduced — `Status` now decides only the index bucket, below).

When you add a roadmap item:

1. **Allocate the next ID** = the highest existing `BE-NNNN` + 1, over every item under `roadmaps/`. Find
   the current max with:
   ```bash
   ls -d roadmaps/BE-*/ | sort | tail -1
   ```
   Never reuse, skip, or guess a number.
2. **Create the item directory and both language files** directly under `roadmaps/` with `Status: Proposal` (a new item is always a
   proposal first) — `roadmaps/BE-NNNN-<slug>/BE-NNNN-<slug>.md`
   (English) and `roadmaps/BE-NNNN-<slug>/BE-NNNN-<slug>-ja.md` (Japanese, same ID & slug). **Do not
   hand-edit the index tables** — they are generated from each item's own metadata. Run
   `make roadmap-index` (or `python scripts/build_roadmap_index.py`) to regenerate the tables between the
   `<!-- GENERATED:* -->` markers in **both** index pages ([en](../roadmaps/README.md), [ja](../roadmaps/README-ja.md)).
   The item's `Status` (its bucket) + `Topic` decide which section it lands in, so an item in an existing
   section needs no manual table edit; `tests/test_roadmap_index.py` (run by `make test`) fails if the
   committed index drifts. The first item of a topic to reach a bucket needs its own marked section (the
   generator names the missing region).
3. **IDs are permanent.** Never renumber an existing item — not when its status changes, not when
   it is completed, not when it is removed from a table. A BE ID, once assigned, refers to that
   item forever.

The number is allocated **on `main`, after the PR merges** — not at PR-open
([BE-0089](../roadmaps/BE-0089-merge-time-be-id-allocation/BE-0089-merge-time-be-id-allocation.md)).
Drafting with the `BE-XXXX` placeholder is the norm: an item keeps `BE-XXXX` through authoring,
review, and the merge itself, and a **BE-creation PR carries no `[BE-NNNN]` prefix at all** — its
title stays a plain scoped subject, since the real number is not known until after the merge. The
merge is a push to `main`, which triggers the `roadmap-id` workflow; it runs the allocator against
`main`, renames each placeholder to the next free `BE-NNNN`, commits the rename and regenerated index
directly to `main`, and comments the allocated id on the merged PR. Because allocation runs in merge
order on `main`, the `BE-NNNN` sequence is **contiguous by construction** — a rejected PR never
merges, so it never spends a number.

Landing that commit on protected `main` needs a bypass identity: a dedicated GitHub App on `main`'s
ruleset bypass list, granted `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` on this repository only,
whose id and private key are stored as the `AUTOMATION_BOT_APP_ID` / `AUTOMATION_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` Actions
secrets. A maintainer sets this up once — see *Setting up the merge-time allocation App* below. Until
those secrets exist the workflow is a green no-op, so `main` stays green while the App is being
provisioned. The job only ever runs reviewed code post-merge (it checks out `main`), pins every
action to a full commit SHA, and runs `scripts/check_renumber_diff.py`, which fails the job if the
bypass commit touches anything outside `roadmaps/` — capping the token's blast radius to that tree.

You may still allocate a number by hand (the highest existing `BE-NNNN` + 1) when you want it fixed
up front; that path is unchanged. BE-0061's collision hardening — the atomic `refs/be-claims/*`
reservations and the `roadmap-id-repair` / `roadmap-claims-gc` workflows — has since been **retired**:
merge-time allocation runs at most one allocate at a time against the latest `main`, so the sequence
is contiguous by construction and two branches can no longer contend for the same number, making the
reservation ledger and its repair backstop redundant. See
[BE-0061](../roadmaps/BE-0061-be-id-allocation-hardening/BE-0061-be-id-allocation-hardening.md).

#### Setting up the merge-time allocation App

A maintainer with admin rights does this once, so the `roadmap-id` workflow can push the renumber
commit past `main`'s branch protection:

1. **Create a GitHub App** (org- or repo-owned) with no webhook and no callback URL. Grant it exactly
   **Repository permissions → Contents: Read and write** (to push the renumber) and **Pull requests:
   Read and write** (to comment the allocated id), and nothing else.
2. **Install it on this repository only**, so its reach is a single repo.
3. **Add the App to `main`'s ruleset bypass list** — it should be the only entry — so its
   installation token can push the renumber commit past branch protection.
4. **Generate a private key** and store it, with the App id, as the `AUTOMATION_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` and
   `AUTOMATION_BOT_APP_ID` Actions secrets (scope them via an Environment tied to the `main` ref so no
   PR-triggered job can read them).

The workflow mints a short-lived (≈1 h) installation token from those secrets for checkout, push, and
`gh`; commits the App makes are signed and attributed to it, so every bypass push is auditable.

#### Tracking issues: who owns an open item (BE-0109)

Every **open** roadmap item — one whose `Status` is `Proposal` or `In progress` — has a GitHub
issue, and that issue's native **Assignees** are the single source of truth for who (if anyone) is
working on it. Because an item gets its issue the moment it exists as a proposal, an issue with **no**
assignee is exactly the "nobody has picked this up yet" signal the roadmap otherwise lacks. Two saved
filters turn the Issues list into the board:

- `label:roadmap-tracking no:assignee` — the **unclaimed backlog** (proposals and in-progress items
  with no one on them).
- `label:roadmap-tracking assignee:<user>` — one person's plate.

**Before you start an item, check its tracking issue** (search
`label:roadmap-tracking BE-NNNN in:title`); if it's unassigned, **self-assign it** when you pick the
work up — exactly as on any other GitHub issue. Don't close a tracking issue by hand: the sync does it.

The issues are created and closed automatically by the `roadmap-tracking-issues` workflow
(`scripts/sync_roadmap_tracking_issues.py`), which runs on `push: main` (paths `roadmaps/**`). The
lifecycle is a pure function of each item's current `Status` — an open item with no matching open
issue gets one; an issue whose item has since shipped (`Implemented`) or been shelved (`Proposal
(deferred)`) is closed — so the sync is idempotent and self-healing (BE-0043 / BE-0061), never
creating a second issue for an item on a re-run. GitHub is the source of truth for both facts —
ownership (Assignees) and whether an issue already exists (an open `roadmap-tracking` issue with the
item's `BE-NNNN` in its title) — so nothing is written back to the repo: the job needs only `issues:
write`, no commit to `main` and no bypass App. It runs on `main` (not the PR) and skips the `BE-XXXX`
placeholder, because a real-numbered issue can only be titled after `roadmap-id` allocates the number
on `main` (BE-0089); that allocation commit is itself a `roadmaps/**` push, which re-triggers the
sync and picks up the now-numbered item. The script calls the network (`gh`), so it never runs inside
`make check`; its read-only `--check` mode reports drift for a maintainer without mutating anything.

Each file follows the **Swift-Evolution proposal format** — a metadata block (`Proposal`,
`Author`, `Status`, `Topic`, plus the optional `Implementing PR`, the cross-item links `Related` /
`Superseded by`, and `Origin`) followed by `## Introduction` / `## Motivation` /
`## Detailed design` / `## Alternatives considered` / `## Progress` / `## References`. Fill what
you can and mark unknowns `TBD`. **`Detailed design` enumerates the work MECE** (mutually exclusive,
collectively exhaustive), and **`Progress` is a living section** (BE-0100) — a checklist mirroring
that breakdown (one `- [ ]` box per unit of work, ticked `- [x]` as it lands) plus a short
chronological PR-linked log — **kept current as work proceeds**: every PR that advances an item ticks
its boxes and adds a log entry in the same change, exactly as it fills `Implementing PR`. A
not-yet-started `Proposal` carries a single placeholder box; an `Implemented` item carries the
all-done checklist. `Related` / `Superseded by` are reciprocal — the superseding item lists the other
under `Related`, the superseded one names its successor under `Superseded by`. These two rules are
review-enforced, not machine-enforced: the gate confirms the `## Progress` section exists and the
fields keep their canonical order, but not that a breakdown is genuinely exhaustive or a box honest.
**Name the author by GitHub handle** —
`* Author: [@handle](https://github.com/handle)`, the account of whoever first authored the item
(for an AI-assisted draft, the person who drove and committed it). The **Status** field is the single
source of truth for the index bucket an item appears under (BE-0078). It does **not** decide the item's
location: since BE-0159 every item lives in one flat `roadmaps/BE-NNNN-<slug>/` directory whose path is
permanent, so `Status` and directory can never disagree because the directory does not depend on `Status`
at all.

| Status | Index bucket |
|---|---|
| `Implemented` | Implemented — shipped |
| `In progress` | In progress — accepted, actively being built |
| `Proposal` | Proposals — under consideration |
| `Proposal (deferred)` | Deferred — parked |

**The code decides the Status — a hard rule.** An item's `Status` tracks whether its implementation
exists, not a preference to keep the item reading as a forward-looking proposal. An item authored with
no code is `Proposal`; the PR that **ships its code** sets `Status` to `Implemented` (or `In progress`
when it lands a partial slice) in that same PR, ticks the matching `Progress` boxes, and records the PR
under `Implementing PR`. `Proposal` is never left standing on an item whose code has already shipped —
that is exactly the promotion the [`implement-be`](../.claude/skills/implement-be/SKILL.md) skill
performs, and it binds humans and agents alike. (The one exception is *authoring* a new item: an
`ideation`-style proposal that ships no code stays `Proposal`, since there is nothing implemented yet.)

As an item advances, **update its Status** and run `make roadmap-index` to regenerate the index (its row
moves to the right bucket automatically). The directory never moves (BE-0159): the same
`roadmaps/BE-NNNN-<slug>/` path holds the item for its whole life, so a promotion no longer rots any link
into or out of it — the concrete win over the folder scheme, which broke a link every time an item's
`Status` changed. **`make lint-roadmap`** (in `make check`) still guards cross-links: it fails if any
item's markdown link to another item does not resolve (a typo'd slug, a link to a renamed item), or if an
`Author` is not a `[@handle](…)` link; `make lint-roadmap ARGS="--fix"` rewrites a broken item link to
the target's current path. Milestones M1–M4 are `BE-0001`–`BE-0004` (implemented).

This is a hard rule agents must follow; the short form is in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Documentation style (every document, both languages)

These rules apply to all documentation — English under `docs/` and the Japanese mirror under
`docs/ja/` — and to every future update, not just new files. Agents must follow them, and they
apply equally when reporting on or summarizing work.

- **Write natural prose.** A Japanese document must read as natural Japanese; an English document
  must read as natural English. A mirror conveys the same content naturally in its own language —
  it is not a word-for-word transliteration of the other.
- **No coined terms.** Use established, widely-used technical terms and ordinary words. Do not
  invent vocabulary, and do not stretch a word into a meaning it does not normally carry.
- **No forced or unnatural translation.** Use the conventional translation of a term. When
  translating it would read unnaturally, keep the original term instead — usually the English word
  (e.g. `selector`, `actuator`, `backend`, `assertion`) rather than a contrived literal rendering.
- **No omissions; be self-contained.** A reader must be able to understand the document on its own.
  Spell out an abbreviation the first time it appears, give a term the context it needs, and do not
  assume the reader has already read another page.
- **Spell out an acronym the first time it appears.** Write the full term first, with the acronym
  in parentheses right after — e.g. role-based access control (RBAC) — then the acronym alone is
  fine for the rest of the document. This applies everywhere the term appears, including roadmap
  items, not only `docs/`.
- **Japanese prose follows the `japanese-tech-writing` skill.** Whether you write the Japanese side
  fresh or translate the English mirror into `docs/ja/` (or a roadmap `*-ja.md`), apply
  [`japanese-tech-writing`](../.claude/skills/japanese-tech-writing/): it is the authoritative style
  for Japanese prose in this repo, and a translation must read as natural Japanese under those norms,
  not a literal rendering of the English.
- **Japanese documents use 敬体 (the polite *desu/masu* style, ですます調).** Every Japanese file
  under `docs/ja/` and every roadmap `*-ja.md` is written in 敬体, never the plain *da/dearu* style
  (常体). Keep the whole document consistent: only sentence-final predicates take the polite form —
  embedded clauses, conditionals, and connective forms (連体修飾・〜すると・〜であり) stay plain as
  usual, and headings or pure noun-phrase labels (体言止め) need no copula.

The short form of these rules is in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Code documentation comments (docstrings) — BE-0065

The *Documentation style* rules above govern the prose docs. This is the companion rule for
**docstrings in the Python core** — what the generated API reference (`make docs`, MkDocs +
`mkdocstrings`) renders. The reference build is a separate, heavier path kept out of `make check`,
adds no LLM, and never runs inside `run`, so the prime directives hold by construction.

- **English, like every code comment.** Code (and its docstrings) is not bilingual; only the prose
  docs under `docs/` are.
- **Google style on the public surface.** The public API — the `Driver` protocol and shared types
  in [`bajutsu/drivers/base.py`](../bajutsu/drivers/base.py), the CLI, the MCP tools, the scenario
  schema, and the public functions of the runner / `assertions` / `network` — uses a one-line
  summary followed by `Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` (and `Yields:` / `Examples:`) **only where
  they add information**. The generated reference excludes private (`_`-prefixed) members.
- **Internal helpers stay prose.** A module-private `_helper` keeps one purposeful line of *why*;
  forcing an `Args:` block onto a small helper is the *what*-narration this repo avoids.
- **Never restate types.** Types live in the annotations (`mypy` is strict, `ruff`'s `ANN` rules are
  on), and the generator reads them from the signature. `Args:` / `Returns:` describe *meaning* —
  units, constraints, what `None` means — not the type.
- **Why, not what.** Rationale, invariants (especially anything protecting determinism),
  trade-offs, edge cases; tie a behavior's rationale to its `BE-NNNN` item. Match the surrounding
  density — short and purposeful, no narration.
- **Keep the per-field idiom.** For a `TypedDict` or a constant-holder class, the per-field inline
  comment carries each field's *why* better than a prose block — keep it rather than converting to
  `Args:`-style sections.

Example — a public function carries the structured sections (the determinism invariant leads, the
rationale ties to a BE item, and the types are *not* repeated):

```python
def resolve_unique(elements: list[Element], sel: Selector) -> Element:
    """Resolve a selector to exactly one element for a single action.

    A single action requires a unique match, so an ambiguous selector fails rather than acting on
    "whatever matched first" (the determinism core, BE-0001).

    Args:
        elements: One `query()` snapshot of the on-screen elements.
        sel: The selector to resolve. `index` is honored only as a last resort, picking the nth of
            several candidates.

    Returns:
        The one element the selector resolves to.

    Raises:
        ElementNotFound: Nothing matched, or `index` is out of range.
        AmbiguousSelector: Two or more matched and no `index` disambiguates.
    """
```

An internal helper stays one line of *why* — no `Args:` block:

```python
def _contains(outer: Frame, inner: Frame) -> bool:
    """Whether `inner`'s frame sits inside `outer`'s (edges inclusive)."""
```

**Migration is phased and incremental** ([BE-0065](../roadmaps/BE-0065-docstring-standard-api-reference/BE-0065-docstring-standard-api-reference.md)):
the site renders today from the existing prose docstrings (typed signatures already give a useful
reference); public-API docstrings move to Google style module by module in small PRs, and the
scoped `ruff` `D` enforcement and Pages hosting land after. **Don't rewrite a whole module's
docstrings as a side effect of an unrelated change** — keep each migration its own small PR.

Build the reference locally with `make docs` (or `make docs-serve` to preview); it needs the `docs`
extra.
