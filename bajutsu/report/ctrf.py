"""Common Test Report Format (CTRF) export (BE-0161).

A pure, deterministic projection of the run's result model into a CTRF document
(https://ctrf.io/) — the same input as `junit_xml()`, a richer output beside it. CTRF is an
open-standard JSON schema (`reportFormat: "CTRF"`, a `results` object of `tool` / `summary` /
`tests`) that a growing ecosystem — PR-comment reporters, dashboards, flaky-test analytics —
reads without per-tool adapters, so Bajutsu's structured extras (steps, engine, device,
attachments) survive the trip in a way JUnit XML can't carry.

Being a post-verdict serialization of already-decided results, it sits outside the
determinism-first contract by construction: no LLM, and writing it can't move the verdict.
