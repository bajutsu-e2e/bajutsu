    `start` runs the adb sequence — boot-readiness wait → optional APK (re)install → `pm clear` for a
    clean state (the `erase` equivalent) → `am force-stop` → runtime-permission pre-grant (`pm grant`,
    BE-0210) → `am start` (launch env forwarded as intent extras) → deeplink — and returns the `adb`
    driver. The lease-shaping methods mirror the iOS
    `_DeviceEnvironment`, over `adb` instead of `simctl`: the same seam, a different subprocess tool.
    Network is not observed *natively* (the adb driver declares no `NETWORK` capability), but the app
    reports its own exchanges to the host collector, which `bridge_collector` reaches over `adb reverse`
    (BE-0283) — the same app-side capture iOS relies on, so a `request` assertion is satisfied without a
    native monitor. Device control backs the subset the emulator can honor
    (`setLocation`, BE-0211, plus clipboard through the app's in-app receiver, BE-0233); the rest of
    the family stays unsupported.
