"""Org-lifecycle serve operations (BE-0375 unit 5): the four `/api/orgs…` endpoints.

An org is `serve`'s multi-tenancy unit, and once a database is wired it is the database — not the
`orgs:` block — that decides who signs in as which org. These operations are how an admin creates a
tenant, replaces its membership, and retires it, without editing the deployment's configuration and
redeploying. Every one is admin-only (`authz.required_role`) and audited; each needs a repository,
since a database-less `serve` is single-user by construction and has no tenant boundary to
administer. All logic is deterministic — a membership list is data, and the sign-in gate that reads
it is the same machine-checkable comparison it was; no LLM enters the path.
