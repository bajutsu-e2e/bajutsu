"""Verify a continuous-integration (CI) job's OpenID Connect (OIDC) token (BE-0414 unit 1).

A CI job can complete no browser sign-in, and once GitHub OAuth is configured the shared token
reaches only worker traffic (BE-0313) — so a pipeline has no credential at all. This module is the
verifying half of the answer: the job presents the OIDC token its platform issues it, `serve`
verifies that token here, and the exchange endpoint mints a short-lived machine session in its
place. Verification runs exactly once per job, at the exchange, never per request.

**Provider-independent by construction.** Everything that decides whether a token is *genuine* —
the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) discovery and cache, the RS256 signature, `iss` / `aud` / `exp` /
`nbf` / `iat`, the serve-side age ceiling, and the single-use `jti` — is the same for every
platform that issues OIDC tokens. What differs is only the *names* of the claims that say which
pipeline is calling: GitHub Actions writes `repository` and `job_workflow_ref`, GitLab writes
`project_path` and `ci_config_ref_uri`. `OidcProvider` is therefore a table of claim names, not a
class hierarchy, and `PROVIDERS` holds one entry per supported platform — which is what BE-0414's
Alternatives deferred when it scoped the item to GitHub Actions first.

`joserfc` ships only with the `oauth` extra, so it is imported inside `verify` rather than at
module scope — the same shape `bajutsu/common/github/app.py` uses for `cryptography` and
`GitHubOAuthClient` uses for `authlib`, and what keeps `import bajutsu.serve` free of it
(`tests/serve/test_import_guard.py`).
