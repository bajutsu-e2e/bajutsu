"""The shared request-gate policy both serve backends enforce (BE-0253).

`serve` runs two HTTP backends behind one API surface — a stdlib `http.server` handler
(`handler.py`) and a FastAPI app (`server/app.py`) — and each must apply the same security
posture: the authentication gate (BE-0051), the unconditional cross-origin (CSRF) `Origin`
check and the `Host` allowlist (BE-0121), and the hardening response headers. Previously each
backend reimplemented that posture independently, so the two copies had to be kept
byte-compatible by hand for the security enforcement to actually match — a latent path to a
security-relevant divergence with nothing checking for it.

This module owns those *policy decisions* once. It is deliberately small and pure: each backend
still owns its own *transport mechanics* — how it reads a request's headers/cookies and writes a
response, and where it drains a body or closes a connection — because those differ (sync stdlib
vs. async ASGI) and are mechanism, not policy. The gate is the shared judgment; the plumbing
around it stays local.

Framework-agnostic by construction — it must import without FastAPI so the default stdlib serve
path stays lean (`tests/serve/test_import_guard.py`).
