# false positive — has neither property, so without its own bound this decline would re-issue a real
# actuation attempt for the rest of the wait. Clock-based, for the reason `_TREE_RETAP_DELAY` records
# for itself: what is being waited out is a presentation animation measured in seconds (a UIKit sheet
# ~0.35-0.5s, an Android dialog enter ~0.25s+). A poll count cannot express that here anyway, because
# `_dismiss_from_tree` is paced by `guard.poll_interval` rather than `_POLL` (see `_observe_native`)
# and that interval is configurable per scenario, target, and flag (BE-0177). Twice the default
# `poll_interval` rather than the animation's own horizon, because the give-up is checked *before*
# the tap: at one interval the very first attempt would exhaust the budget, leaving a transient scrim
# no retry at all. That is also why the horizon is *derived* from the interval rather than fixed. A
# scenario may tune `pollInterval` upwards (the save-password one sets 5), and a fixed 2s would

    The `handleSystemAlert` step's wait, which BE-0406 moved out of the XCUITest driver so the
    reactive guard can act while it runs. Before, the driver polled SpringBoard to its own deadline
    and nothing else could intervene inside that call, so a prompt the scenario had already declared
    — iOS's save-password alert, raised into the app's own process and invisible to this query —
    held the screen for the step's whole timeout, and the step failed naming the permission prompt
    it never saw rather than the alert that was actually up.

    Each poll reads the step's own target first and only then hands the tree to the guard. That
    order is what keeps the two from answering the same prompt when a scenario holds a `rules` entry
    for it with the opposite choice; the gate closes the rest of that window itself, since it is
    given `sel` and declines an alert `sel` names (`probe_native`'s `"reserved"`).

    Args:
        timeout: The step's own deadline. Zero reads once and gives up, so a caller that already
            knows a prompt is up pays no poll.
        alert_guard: The scenario's reactive guard, when the run has one. Without it this is a plain
            condition wait — the shape `record`'s replay gets.
        alerts: The step's outcome list, which the guard appends each prompt it dismissed to.
        cancelled: Consulted once per poll, right where the deadline is, so a cancelled run is
            noticed within one tick instead of actuating the device for the rest of the timeout
            (BE-0370). It raises rather than returning a verdict: the prompt neither appeared nor
            timed out, and the scenario is over either way.

    Raises:
        base.UnsupportedAction: the backend does not advertise `HANDLE_SYSTEM_ALERT`.
        RunCancelled: the run was cancelled while this step was waiting.

    Returns:
        `(ok, reason)`. The reason names what the step actually saw: no alert at all, an alert whose
        buttons `sel` did not name, one offering `sel`'s label twice, or — through the guard's own

    """Condition wait. Polls query() (or the observed network) until satisfied instead
    of a fixed sleep.

    When `trace` is given (a `for` wait only), each poll is recorded into it so a timeout can be
    diagnosed from artifacts (BE-0231 Unit 1); it never changes the wait's outcome.

    When `alert_guard` is given, the branches a system alert can *stall* — `for`, `settled`, and
    `screenChanged` (where a collapsed tree keeps the condition unmet and would otherwise burn the
    whole timeout) — drive the guard mid-wait, then resume polling against the *same* `deadline`. On
    an iOS backend the guard queries SpringBoard natively on its own interval (BE-0315, reusing
    BE-0316's primitive); elsewhere it watches the already-fetched tree for the collapsed-tree
    signature of a blocking prompt (BE-0269). The condition check still decides pass/fail; the guard
    only accelerates recovery, and dismissed alerts are appended to `alerts` (the step's outcome
    list) for the report. A block it cannot clear is not acted on at all (BE-0402) — it is appended
    to the timeout this returns, so the failure names the alert instead of only the element that
    never appeared. `gone` is guarded
    too. It was not, on the reasoning that a collapsed tree already satisfies "gone" and returns at
    once — true of a SpringBoard prompt, which covers the app and empties its tree, but only of
    those. A prompt drawn *inside* the app's own process collapses nothing and instead **adds** its
    buttons to the tree, so a `gone` wait on one of them sits unsatisfied for its whole timeout with
    nothing to clear it. iOS's "Save Password" alert is exactly that shape, which is how the gap
    surfaced. `request` polls the network, not the screen, so it is still not guarded.

    When `on_interrupt_poll` is given, it is called with each poll's already-fetched tree — after
    the wait's own condition is checked, so it fires only while the wait is still blocked — so a
    scenario's `interrupts` handlers can clear an interstitial screen mid-wait (BE-0314). Like the
    alert guard, it rides on the poll the wait already performs (zero extra query) and resumes
    against the *same* `deadline`; the `gone`/`request` branches are not hooked (a collapsed tree
    already satisfies `gone`, and `request` polls the network, not the screen). A `True` return ends
    the wait immediately (skipping the `deadline` check) rather than burning the rest of the
    timeout: an interrupt's own recovery `steps` can fail, and that failure is already decided by
    the first poll that hits it, so polling on would only turn a fast, loud failure into a slow one.
    The caller (the run loop) knows the real reason and overrides the placeholder this returns.

    When `on_tick` is given, a throttled "still waiting …" line is emitted while the wait is pending:
    once on entry — so even an instantly-satisfied wait surfaces its condition — then every
    `_TICK_INTERVAL` until it resolves. It is display only and never affects the outcome.

    `transitions` (BE-0310) is the `settled` branch's read-only screen-transition signal; the
    default reports none, so `settled` keeps its unchanged tree-diff behavior unless a caller passes
    a real source.

    `cancelled` (BE-0370) is consulted once per poll, right where the deadline is, so a wait blocked
    on a condition notices a cancelled run within one polling tick instead of burning the rest of
    its timeout. It raises `RunCancelled` rather than returning a verdict: the condition is neither
    satisfied nor timed out, and the scenario is over either way. The condition check comes first, so
    a wait already satisfied on that poll still passes.

    Returns `(ok, reason, tree)` where `tree` is the last screen the wait queried — the settled
    device state, since nothing actuates in a wait. The caller reuses it as the step's `after`
    snapshot instead of re-querying (BE-0259). It is `None` for the `request` variant, which polls
    the observed network rather than the tree, so there is no screen read to hand back.

    When `transitions` has reported a screen-transition event *since this wait began*
    (`events[-1][1] >= start`), settled is a positive signal — no further transition reported for
    `_TRANSITION_QUIESCENCE` — rather than an inference from tree reads; see
    `_wait_settled_by_signal`. This is re-checked on every poll, not only at entry: `viewDidAppear`'s
    report is POSTed fire-and-forget *after* the appearance animation, so for the canonical
    tap → navigate → `settled` step it lands a few hundred ms into the wait, not before it — the wait
    switches onto the signal path the instant that report arrives, mirroring the readiness gate's
    per-tick re-read. The since-start guard mirrors the one the readiness gate applies to the same
    signal (BE-0310): a transition left over from a *prior* step (the collector is scenario-scoped,
    not per-wait) predates `start`, so it is ignored rather than settling this wait instantly and
    missing the current step's own transition. Until a since-start transition is observed (the app
    doesn't link the observer, or its report is still in flight), this runs the original tree-diff
    behavior, which waits the animation out: a blank/collapsed tree (e.g. a screen mid-render, or one
    covered by a system alert) is never treated as settled, and settled is two consecutive unchanged
    polls with an identified element. Both paths are best-effort: timing out
    just proceeds with the current screen — a settle is a stabilization hint, not a correctness
    assertion, so it never fails the step. When `gate` is given, a screen that stays collapsed (a
    system alert) is cleared mid-settle rather than burning the whole timeout (BE-0269). When `hb` is
    given, it emits the throttled "still waiting …" progress line while settling. Returns the last
    queried tree so the caller can reuse it as the step's `after` snapshot (BE-0259).

    A `True` from `on_interrupt_poll` ends the settle immediately (BE-0314) — a failed interrupt
    recovery is a decided outcome the caller (the run loop) fails the step on, so polling toward
    settled would only delay a failure that best-effort settling would otherwise mask. `cancelled`
    raises `RunCancelled` out of the settle the same way it does out of every other wait branch
    (BE-0370): settling is best-effort, but a cancelled run has nothing left to settle *for*.
