    `lease(eff, scenario)` leases a free udid (blocking until one frees up), launches the app
    pointed at that device's own network collector, and returns a `Lease` whose evidence sink
    (interval recordings under `run_dir`), relaunch, and device control are all bound to the leased
    device; `Lease.release()` terminates the app and returns the udid to the pool. A single-device
    run is just a pool of one, so network collection / interval evidence / device control work the
    same whether `workers` is 1 or N. The only shared state is the thread-safe free-device queue and
    the collectors / catalog maps, whose only in-lease writes re-key one exclusively-leased device
    onto its replacement, so leases need no lock.

    Args:
        udids: The devices to pool; the web backend ignores these (one browser lane).
        backends: Requested platforms/actuators; the first available one is selected.
        eff: The resolved target config.
        run_dir: Where each lease's interval evidence is written.
        network: Observe network traffic — iOS starts one HTTP collector per device up front; web
            hooks the page per lease.
        log_predicate: An `os_log` predicate scoping captured device logs. None captures none.
        log_subsystem: The app log subsystem to capture. None captures none.
        secret_values: Raw secret values to redact from evidence.
        provision: The device provider's readiness report (BE-0236) — a cloud device handed over
            already booted / with the app installed lets the environment skip that setup. None (the
            local provider's inert profile) runs the full per-platform bring-up, unchanged.
        available: Actuator-availability probe, injectable for tests.
        env_run: The subprocess runner for simctl, injectable for tests.
        make_driver: Builds a backend's driver; injectable so a test can supply a read-only
            evidence provider's driver (BE-0020).
        evidence_providers: Resolves the read-only evidence provider per gap kind (BE-0020),
            injectable for tests; defaults to the same-platform resolver.
