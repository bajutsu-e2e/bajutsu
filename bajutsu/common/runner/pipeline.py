    """Run every scenario, each on a freshly leased device, and return one result per scenario.

    `lease(eff, scenario)` blocks until a device is free, launches the app, and returns a `Lease`
    bundling the live driver with that device's evidence sink / relaunch / control / network
    collector; `lease.release()` afterwards terminates the app and returns the device to the pool.
    A lease's collector, when present, has its exchanges cleared per scenario, exposed to `request`
    assertions, and written to `<sid>/network.json` (redacted with `secret_values`).

    Args:
        eff: The resolved target config (drives redaction, backend, launch).
        scenarios: The scenarios to run; results come back in this declaration order.
        lease: Leases a device and launches the app for one scenario (a single-device run is a pool
            of one).
        clock: Injectable time source for condition waits, so tests need no real sleeps. None uses
            the real clock.
        alert_guard: A single alert-guard handler, used by tests.
        alert_guard_for: Picks each scenario's alert-guard handler (honoring its `systemAlertHandling`);
            takes precedence over `alert_guard`.
        run_dir: Where per-scenario artifacts (network.json, visual diffs) are written. None skips
            writing them.
        workers: Concurrent scenarios; >1 hands each worker its own device + per-device resources,
            so the loop keeps no shared mutable state.
        bindings: `secrets.<name>` → value substitutions applied to step inputs.
        secret_values: The raw secret values to redact from evidence.
        progress: Receives one-line progress messages (the web UI streams these). None is silent.
        baselines_dir: Baseline images for `visual` assertions. None disables visual comparison.
        schemas_dir: Directory the `responseSchema` assertions' schema files resolve against. None
            disables them.
        actuator: The single selected actuator (e.g. `xcuitest` / `playwright`); when given, each scenario
            is preflighted against its static capability set and failed up front if it needs a
            capability the actuator lacks (BE-0082). None skips the fixed preflight (a lease driven
            directly in tests, or when `resolve_actuator` chooses per scenario instead).
        resolve_actuator: Per-scenario actuator resolver (BE-0240); when given, each scenario's
            actuator — and thus the capability set it is preflighted against — is resolved from the
            scenario's own steps (cheapest sufficient), instead of the one fixed `actuator`. Mutually
            exclusive with `actuator` (passing both raises): the CLI's single-engine path and `audit`
            pass this, the cross-browser matrix passes `actuator`.
        golden_context: Goldens directory for `golden` assertions (BE-0006). None disables them.
        lease_udid_spec: The run's resolved udid spec (the provider's `udid_spec`). A WebDriver URL
            routes the run to the live XCUITest environment, so the preflight narrows to that
            transport's set (BE-0238) — the same `is_webdriver_endpoint` signal `environment_for`
            routes on. "booted" (the default) is never a URL, so the local path is unchanged.
        on_score: Sink for the app's entry-screen convention score, emitted once from the first
            scenario's freshly launched driver (the `run --score` inline of `doctor`'s grade). None
            (the default) scores nothing; diagnostic only, never on the verdict path.
        crash_retries: How many times to re-run a scenario whose backend crashed mid-run
            (`base.BackendCrashError`) on a fresh device before failing it. A crash is backend
            infrastructure, not a verdict; the default (None) reads `BAJUTSU_CRASH_RETRIES` — 1 when
            unset — so a loaded CI lane can raise the budget without a code change, while a scenario
            that crashes every attempt still fails loudly once it is spent (BE-0049). 0 disables the
            recovery. The replay re-runs the whole scenario on a respawned (not erased) app, so it is
            safe only for scenarios idempotent up to the crash point.
        crash_recovery_budget: A wall-clock ceiling (seconds) on the total time one scenario may spend
            respawning after a crash, on top of `crash_retries` (the count). None reads
            `BAJUTSU_CRASH_RECOVERY_BUDGET` — unset is unbounded (count is the only cap, unchanged).
            It stops recovery once spent so a never-recovering runner can't burn crash_retries x the
            cold-startup ceiling and blow a job's timeout; the first respawn is never blocked, so a
            genuine one-off is still ridden out.
        run_crash_recovery_budget: A wall-clock ceiling (seconds) on the total time crash recovery may
            spend across this one `run_all` call, not just one scenario. Note the scoping: the
            cross-browser matrix (`run_matrix_and_report`) runs `run_all` once per engine, so each
            engine pass gets its own full budget rather than sharing one. None reads
            `BAJUTSU_RUN_CRASH_RECOVERY_BUDGET` — unset is unbounded, unchanged from before this
            parameter existed. `crash_recovery_budget` resets for every new scenario, so a device that
            keeps degrading pays it again and again; this bounds the cumulative spend instead, so the
            run fails loudly once it is exhausted rather than each scenario silently re-spending its
            own budget until an external timeout cancels the job. The first respawn anywhere in the
            run is never blocked, the same never-block-the-first-respawn rule
            `crash_recovery_budget` already follows per scenario.
        force_erase_on_retry: Whether a crash-triggered retry (attempt > 1) may force
            `preconditions.erase=True`, the same recovery a scenario already gets by declaring
            `erase: true` (see `_ScenarioRunner.run_one`). True (the default) preserves every
            existing caller's behavior. `bajutsu run --no-erase` passes False here, carrying the
            operator's explicit opt-out past `_filter_scenarios`'s per-scenario resolution — the CLI
            resolves every scenario's `preconditions.erase` to a concrete bool before `run_all` ever
            sees it, so that field alone cannot distinguish "the operator asked to keep the device"
            from "nobody said anything" by the time a retry decides whether to force it.
        cancelled: Reports whether this run has been asked to stop (BE-0370). A scenario the request
            reaches — at a step boundary, inside a condition wait's poll, or before it was leased at
            all — comes back as `RunResult(ok=False, failure="cancelled")`, so the caller still
            receives one result per scenario and writes an ordinary failed run's report. The default
            never cancels, leaving every existing caller unchanged.

    Returns:
        One result per scenario, in the same order as `scenarios`.
